title: Build and Deploy a Jaspr Website on Globe
description: Use Jaspr to build and deploy a server-rendered site in Dart.
---

<Image src="/assets/guides/jaspr.png" />

Jaspr is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart, supporting both **client-side** and **server-side** rendering. It's well-suited for a wide range of web applications, from **document-centric** sites to dynamic **single-page apps**.

Globe has built-in support for deploying Jaspr applications, automatically detecting the framework and its rendering mode to apply the correct build settings.

### Features Covered

- Using the Jaspr CLI to create a new project
- Globe's automatic framework detection for Jaspr
- Deploying a Jaspr application with the Globe CLI

### Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK Installed**: If you have Flutter installed, the Dart SDK is already included. If not, [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- **Globe Account**: You'll need an account to deploy projects. [Sign up or log in to Globe](https://globe.dev/login).
- **Globe CLI Installed and Authenticated**: Install the CLI by running `dart pub global activate globe_cli` and log in using `globe login`.
- **Jaspr CLI Installed**: Install the Dart Frog CLI by running `dart pub global activate jaspr_cli`.

## Step 1: Create Your Jaspr Project

Create a new Jaspr application using the rendering mode that best fits your project's needs.

- Run the `jaspr create` command:

  ```bash
  jaspr create my-jaspr-site
  cd my-jaspr-site
  ```

## Step 2: Test Your Application Locally (Optional)

Before deploying, it's a good practice to test your application locally to make sure everything is working as expected.

- From your project directory (`my-jaspr-site`), run the local development server:

  ```bash
  jaspr serve
  ```

- Open your browser and navigate to the local address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

## Step 3: Deploy to Globe

Deploying your Jaspr site to Globe is a single command. Globe will automatically identify that it's a Jaspr project and handle the build process for you.

- From your project's root directory, run the deploy command:

  ```bash
  globe deploy
  ```

- If this is your first time deploying this project, the CLI will guide you through creating and linking a new Globe project.

## Step 4: View Your Deployed Website

Once the deployment is complete, the Globe CLI will output the live URL for your website.

- Navigate to the provided URL in your browser to see your live Jaspr website.

Your Jaspr website is now deployed globally. You have successfully built and deployed a Dart web application using Globe.

## What's Next

- Add a [Custom Domain](/core-concepts/domains) to your new website for professional branding
- Set up [GitHub Integration](/core-concepts/github-integration) to automatically deploy your site on every code push
- Read the official [Jaspr documentation](https://docs.jaspr.site/) to learn more about building with the framework
