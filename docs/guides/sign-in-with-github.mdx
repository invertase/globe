title: Implement Sign in with GitHub using Dart Frog
description: Learn to build a complete OAuth 2.0 flow, allowing users to sign in to your application securely with their GitHub account.
---

Social logins are a must-have feature for modern applications. They provide a fast, trusted, and secure way for users to sign up and log in without creating a new set of credentials. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular choice, especially for developer-focused tools.

This guide will walk you through building the complete backend flow for "Sign in with GitHub" using [Dart Frog](https://dart-frog.dev/). You'll learn how to configure a GitHub OAuth App, handle the redirect flow, securely exchange an authorization code for an access token, and use that token to fetch a user's profile.

  foundational tutorial, [What is OAuth 2.0?](/tutorials/what-is-oauth), before
  you start.

### Features Covered

- Configuring a GitHub OAuth App
- Handling OAuth 2.0 redirects in Dart Frog
- Securely loading secrets from a .env file using middleware
- Using an access token to fetch user data from GitHub's API

### Prerequisites

- A **GitHub account**: Sign up or log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- **Dart Frog CLI Installed**: Install the Dart Frog CLI by running `dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli`.

## Step 1: Configure Your GitHub OAuth App

First, you need to register your application with GitHub to get your API credentials.

1. Navigate to your GitHub **Developer settings** (Profile Picture > Settings > Developer settings).
2. Click on **OAuth Apps**, then **New OAuth App**.
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Application name**: My Dart Frog App
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:8080`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`
4. Click **Register application**.
5. On the next screen, you'll see your **Client ID**. Click **Generate a new client secret**.
6. **Copy both the Client ID and the new Client Secret**. Keep them safe.

## Step 2: Create and Set Up Your Dart Frog Project

Now, create a Dart Frog project and add the necessary dependencies.

- Create the project:

  ```bash
  dart_frog create github_auth_app
  cd github_auth_app
  ```

- Open the newly created `github_auth_app` folder in your favorite code editor.
- Add the dependencies for making API calls and loading environment variables:

  ```bash
  dart pub add http
  dart pub add dotenv
  ```

## Step 3: Store and Load Your Secrets

We will use a `.env` file for your secret credentials and a middleware to load them into your application's context.

- In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`.
- Add your GitHub credentials to this file:

  ```env
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
  ```

- **Important**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
- Next, create a root middleware to make these variables available to all routes. Create a file at `routes/middleware.dart`:

  ```dart
  import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
  import 'package:dotenv/dotenv.dart';

  // Create a single, top-level instance of DotEnv and load the file.
  final _env = DotEnv(includePlatformEnvironment: true)..load();

  Handler middleware(Handler handler) {
    // Provide the DotEnv instance to all routes.
    return handler.use(provider<DotEnv>((_) => _env));
  }
  ```

## Step 4: Create the Redirect Endpoint

This route will kick off the login process by redirecting the user to GitHub.

- Create a new file at `routes/auth/github.dart`.
- Add the following code, which correctly constructs the redirect response:

  ```dart
  import 'dart:io';
  import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
  import 'package:dotenv/dotenv.dart';

  Response onRequest(RequestContext context) {
    final env = context.read<DotEnv>();
    final clientId = env['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'];

    final uri = Uri.https('github.com', '/login/oauth/authorize', {
      'client_id': clientId,
      'scope': 'read:user', // Request permission to read user profile data
    });

    // Construct the redirect response.
    return Response(
      statusCode: HttpStatus.found,
      headers: {
        HttpHeaders.locationHeader: uri.toString(),
      },
    );
  }
  ```

## Step 5: Create the Callback Endpoint

This is where GitHub redirects the user back after they approve your app. This route contains the core logic.

- Create a new file at `routes/auth/callback.dart`.
- Add the following code:

  ```dart
  import 'dart:convert';
  import 'dart:io';
  import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
  import 'package:dotenv/dotenv.dart';
  import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

  Future<Response> onRequest(RequestContext context) async {
    final code = context.request.uri.queryParameters['code'];
    if (code == null) {
      return Response(statusCode: HttpStatus.badRequest, body: 'Missing code');
    }

    final env = context.read<DotEnv>();
    final clientId = env['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'];
    final clientSecret = env['GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'];

    // Exchange the code for an access token.
    final tokenResponse = await http.post(
      Uri.parse('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token'),
      headers: {'Accept': 'application/json'},
      body: {'client_id': clientId, 'client_secret': clientSecret, 'code': code},
    );

    // Cast the decoded JSON to a Map for type safety.
    final tokenJson = jsonDecode(tokenResponse.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final accessToken = tokenJson['access_token'] as String;

    // Use the access token to get the user's profile.
    final userResponse = await http.get(
      Uri.parse('https://api.github.com/user'),
      headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $accessToken'},
    );

    // Cast the decoded JSON for type safety.
    final userJson = jsonDecode(userResponse.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final username = userJson['login'] as String;

    return Response(
      body: '<html><h1>Success!</h1><p>Logged in as $username.</p></html>',
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/html'},
    );
  }
  ```

## Step 6: Test the Full Flow

- Start the Dart Frog development server:
  ```bash
  dart_frog dev
  ```
- Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/auth/github`
- You will be redirected to GitHub to log in and authorize the application.
- After authorizing, you will be redirected back to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback` and see the "Success!" message with your GitHub username.

## What's Next

- **Get Started Quickly**: Use our [GitHub OAuth template](https://globe.dev/templates/dartfrog_github_auth/) to bootstrap your project with all the code from this guide and more.
- **Implement Google Sign-In**: Apply the same OAuth 2.0 pattern by following our How to Implement Sign in with Google using Dart Frog guide.
- **Create a Session**: Instead of just showing a success page, create a JWT for the user to manage a real session in your application.
