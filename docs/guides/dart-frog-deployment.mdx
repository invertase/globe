### Features Covered

- Globe CLI setup
- Dart Frog project setup
- Deploying with Globe CLI
- Automatic framework detection
- Environment variables

### Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK Installed**: If you have Flutter installed, the Dart SDK is already included. If not, [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- **Globe Account**: You'll need an account to deploy projects. [Sign up or log in to Globe](https://globe.dev/login).
- **Globe CLI Installed and Authenticated**: Install the CLI by running `dart pub global activate globe_cli` and log in using `globe login`.
- **Dart Frog CLI Installed**: Install the Dart Frog CLI by running `dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli`.
- **An Existing Dart Frog Project**: You should have a Dart Frog project ready for deployment. If you're new to Dart Frog or need help creating one, refer to the [official Dart Frog documentation](https://dart-frog.dev/getting-started). You can test it locally by running `dart_frog dev` in your project directory.

## Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and change to the root directory of your Dart Frog project (the one containing your `pubspec.yaml` file and `routes` folder).

```bash
cd path/to/your/my_dart_frog_app
```

## Step 2: Deploy Your Dart Frog Backend

Run the `globe deploy` command from your project's root directory.

```bash
globe deploy
```

If this is the first time deploying this project from this location, the Globe CLI will automatically initiate the linking process, guiding you through selecting an existing Globe project or creating a new one before proceeding with the deployment.

Globe will automatically detect that you are deploying a Dart Frog application and apply the correct framework preset. No additional configuration specific to Dart Frog is typically required for the deployment to proceed.

For a production deployment (to your live application), use the `--prod` flag:

```bash
globe deploy --prod
```

## Step 3: Access Your Deployed Backend

Once the deployment is complete, the Globe CLI will output a URL (e.g., `your-project-name.globeapp.dev` or a preview URL). You can use this URL to access your live Dart Frog backend.

Your Dart Frog backend is now deployed and accessible via a unique URL By leveraging Globe's built-in support for Dart Frog, you have successfully deployed your backend application with a quick and automated process, unlocking the value of effortless deployment and scaling.
