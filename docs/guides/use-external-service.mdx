title: How to Use External APIs & Packages in Your Globe Backend
description: Use pub.dev packages and call external APIs from your Dart backend.
---

Integrating a dedicated error-tracking service like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) gives you detailed, real-time insights into application issues, including stack traces and request context.

This guide walks through integrating a Dart backend with Sentry. It shows how you aren't limited to Globe's built-in logging and can integrate with other developer services.

### Features Covered

- Integrating a third-party service (Sentry) for observability
- Using a package from pub.dev
- Managing API keys with Globe Environment Variables
- Capturing exceptions from a live deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK Installed**: If you have Flutter installed, the Dart SDK is already included. If not, [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- **Globe Account**: You'll need an account to deploy projects. [Sign up or log in to Globe](https://globe.dev/login).
- **Globe CLI Installed and Authenticated**: Install the CLI by running `dart pub global activate globe_cli` and log in using `globe login`.
- **Sentry account**: Sign up for a free account at [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Sentry Project

First, you need a Sentry project and a `DSN` key, which tells your application where to send errors.

- Log in to your Sentry account and click **Create Project**
- From the list of platforms, select **Flutter**. This will configure the project with the correct SDK that includes support for pure Dart
- Give your project a name (e.g., `globe-backend`) and click **Create Project**
- Sentry will display your `DSN` key. Copy this key; you will need it in the next step

## Step 2: Prepare Your Globe Backend Project

We will use the standard Dart Shelf server template to create our project.

- In your terminal, run the `dart create` command:

  ```bash
  dart create --template=server-shelf my-sentry-backend
  cd my-sentry-backend
  ```

- Add the official Sentry package to your project's dependencies:

  ```bash
  dart pub add sentry
  ```

## Step 3: Create or Link Your Globe Project

Before deploying, associate your local project directory with a Globe project. If you don't have one for this application yet, this command will help you create it.

- In your terminal, from your project's root directory (`my-sentry-backend`), run:

  ```bash
  globe link
  ```

  Follow the prompts to **create a new project**.

## Step 4: Securely Configure the Sentry DSN

Now that your Globe project exists, add the Sentry `DSN` as an environment variable. This keeps your `DSN` key secure and out of your source code.

- In the [Globe dashboard](https://globe.dev/login), navigate to the project you just created
- Open **Settings â†’ Environment Variables**
- Select **Add Variable**
- For the **Name**, enter `SENTRY_DSN`
- For the **Value**, paste the DSN key you copied from Sentry
- Leave the environment setting as **All Environments** and select **Save**

<Info>
  For a real-world application, you would typically create two separate projects
  in Sentry: one for production and one for preview/testing. You can then add
  two `SENTRY_DSN` variables in Globe, one for each environment, to keep your
  error data separate.
</Info>

## Step 5: Initialize Sentry in Your Application

Now, add the Sentry initialization logic to your server's main function. The Sentry client should be initialized before the server starts handling requests.

- Open the `bin/server.dart` file in your project
- In the `main` function, add the call to `Sentry.init`. The client will read the DSN from the environment variables you configured previously

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

// Your existing handlers...

Future<void> main() async {
  // Initialize Sentry
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = Platform.environment['SENTRY_DSN'];
      // You can add more configuration here if needed
      options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    },
  );

  final ip = InternetAddress.anyIPv4;

  final handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler(_router); // Assuming your router is named _router

  final port = int.parse(Platform.environment['PORT'] ?? '8080');
  final server = await io.serve(handler, ip, port);
  print('Server listening on port ${server.port}');
}
```

## Step 6: Create an Endpoint to Trigger a Test Error

To verify the integration is working, create a new API endpoint that deliberately throws an exception.

- In the same server file, add a new route to your router that throws an error

```dart
// In your router setup
_router.get('/trigger-error', (Request request) {
  try {
    throw StateError('This is a test error from Globe!');
  } catch (exception, stackTrace) {
    // Capture the exception and send it to Sentry
    Sentry.captureException(exception, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    // Return an error response to the client
    return Response.internalServerError(
      body: 'An error was triggered and reported to Sentry.'
    );
  }
});
```

## Step 7: Deploy and Test the Integration

Deploy the application to Globe and call the new endpoint to see the error appear in your Sentry dashboard.

- Run the deploy command for a production deployment:

  ```bash
  globe deploy --prod
  ```

- Once the deployment is complete, the CLI will provide a URL. Take that URL and append your new path to it (e.g., `https://your-app.globeapp.dev/trigger-error`)
- Visit the full URL in your browser. You should see the error message
- Go back to your Sentry dashboard. Within a few moments, you will see the captured error, complete with the stack trace and other details

By connecting your Globe backend to an external service like Sentry, you can add advanced observability to your application.

### What's Next

- Remember that any changes to Environment Variables require you to redeploy your project for them to take effect
- Explore the [Environment Variables documentation](/core-concepts/environment-variables) to learn more about managing configurations for different environments
