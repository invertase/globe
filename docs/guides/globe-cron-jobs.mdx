title: How to Schedule Cron Jobs on Globe
description: Automate recurring tasks by defining and deploying scheduled HTTP requests.

<Image src="/assets/guides/cron-jobs.png" />

Automating recurring background tasks, such as database cleanups or nightly reports, is a common requirement for backend applications. Globe allows you to schedule these jobs by defining HTTP-based cron jobs directly in your project configuration.

This guide walks through defining a cron job in a globe.yaml file, creating an endpoint in a Dart Shelf application to handle the task, and verifying its status in the Globe dashboard.

### Features Covered

- Creating and configuring a `globe.yaml` file
- Defining a cron schedule and path
- Implementing an endpoint handler in Dart to receive the cron request
- Viewing and managing cron jobs in the Globe dashboard

### Prerequisites

- A Globe Account and the Globe CLI installed and authenticated
- An existing Dart backend project deployed on Globe (e.g., a Shelf API)

## Step 1: Create the globe.yaml File

Configuration for Globe-specific features like cron jobs is done in a `globe.yaml` file.

- In the **root directory** of your Dart project, create a new file named `globe.yaml`.

## Step 2: Define Your Cron Job

Inside the YAML file, you will define your scheduled task. Each job requires a unique `id`, a `schedule` in standard cron syntax, and a `path` that Globe will call in your application.

- Add the following content to your `globe.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  crons:
    - id: daily-digest-email
      schedule: '0 9 * * *' # Runs every day at 9:00 AM UTC
      path: '/tasks/send-daily-digest'
  ```

<Info>
  **Info:** You can use a tool like [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) to
  help verify your cron schedule expressions. All schedules run in the **UTC**
  timezone only.
</Info>

## Step 3: Implement the Endpoint Handler

Your application needs to have an endpoint that matches the path you defined. Globe will send an HTTP `POST` request to this endpoint according to your schedule.

- In your Dart Shelf application, add a new route to your router that listens for `POST` requests on the specified path.

  ```dart
  // In your main server file, add this to your shelf_router setup
  _router.post('/tasks/send-daily-digest', (Request request) {
    // Your logic for sending the digest email would go here.
    print('CRON JOB EXECUTED: Sending daily digest email...');
    // Return a 2xx status code to indicate success.
    return Response.ok('Digest job processed.');
  });
  ```

- If your handler returns a status code outside the `2xx` range, Globe will display it as an error in the dashboard.

## Step 4: Deploy Your Application

For the cron job to be scheduled, you must deploy your application to production.

- From your project's root directory, run the **deploy** command:

  ```bash
  globe deploy --prod
  ```

<Info>
  **Info:** Cron jobs only run on **production deployments**, not on preview
  deployments. They are synchronized with each successful production deployment.
</Info>

## Step 5: Verify the Cron Job in the Dashboard

After a successful production deployment, you can verify that Globe has registered your scheduled task.

- In the Globe dashboard, navigate to your project
- Select the **Cron Jobs** tab
- You should see your `daily-digest-email` job listed as **Active**. If you later remove the job from your globe.yaml and redeploy, it will become inactive.

You have now scheduled a recurring task for your Dart backend using Globe's built-in cron job support.

- Explore the full capabilities of the [Globe CLI](/core-concepts/cli)
- If your cron job fails, you can investigate the issue by checking your application's [Logs](/core-concepts/logs)
