The token command helps you to create a token that can be used in any environment, especially in your CI providers.

## Create

The `create` command allows you to create auth tokens for your projects. You can use this token to login to Globe in any environment.

### Usage

You can run the command interactively by running 

```bash
globe token create
```
after running this command, you will be prompted to enter a name or expiry and select a list of projects that you want to associate this token to. 

Alternatively, you can use the necessary arguments and pass the interactive mode: 

- `--name`- specify a name to identify the token.
- `--expiry` - specify lifespan of the token.
- `--project` - specify projects(s) to associate the token with.

```bash
globe token create --name="Foo Bar" --expiry="yyyy-mm-dd" --project="project-id-1" --project="project-id-2"
```

Note: to run this command, you should be at the root of your project.

## List Tokens

The `list` command lists all tokens associated with the current project.

### Usage

```bash
globe token list
```

Note: to run this command, you should be at the root of your project and it returns a list of tokens associated with your current project. 

## Delete Token

The `delete` command allows you to delete a token by providing a token ID.

### Usage

```bash
globe token delete --tokenId="token-id-goes-here"
```
