title: Login to Globe

# Login

The `login` command allows you to authenticate your local CLI with your Globe account. This is required before you can deploy any projects.

## Usage

```bash
globe login
```

A new browser window will open prompting you to login to your Globe account. Once you have logged in, you will be redirected to a page notifying you of a successful login. You can close this page once complete.
Globe will store a secure token on your local machine to authenticate future requests.

If you wish to [logout](/cli/commands/logout), you can run the following command:

```bash
globe logout
```
