title: Link a project to Globe
---

# Link

The `link` command links a local Dart project to a Globe project. Linking is required to deploy a project to Globe.

Project linking is carried out automatically if the project is not yet linked when running the [`deploy`](/cli/commands/deploy) command.

## Usage

```bash
globe link
```

The `link` command will first prompt, asking whether you wish to continue linking the local project. If you continue, you will be further prompted to:

1. Select an account you wish to link this local project to.
2. Select, or create a new project to link this local project to.

Upon completion, the local project will be linked to your Globe account and you will be able to deploy it.

## How it works

A linked project stores metadata about the project in the local `.dart_tool/dart_globe` directory on your machine. This metadata is used to identify the project when deploying to Globe. If not already,
the `.dart_tool` directory should not be committed to your Git repository. You can add this directory to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it is not committed.

If you accidentally delete this directory or run the [`unlink`](/cli/commands/unlink) command, you will need to re-link the project before you can deploy again.
