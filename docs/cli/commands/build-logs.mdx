The `build-logs` command allows you to view the live build logs of a running deployment. The deployment must be in the `building` state for this command to work. The --deployment flag is required.

## Usage

To use, run the following command with the deployment ID of the currently running deployment.

```bash
globe build-logs -d <DEPLOYMENT-ID>
```

### Flags

The command has flags (in addition to [global flags](/cli#global-flags)) that can be used to modify the behavior of the command, which can be accessed by running `globe build-logs --<flag>`:

- `-d, --deployment` - Provide the deployment ID of the deployment you want to view the build logs for
