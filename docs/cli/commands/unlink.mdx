title: Unlink Projects from Globe
---

The `unlink` command removes any previously linked projects from the current local project. This will prevent you from deploying the project to Globe.

## Unlinking a Single Project

```bash
globe unlink
```

## How it works

The command removes the `.dart_tool/dart_globe` directory from the local project. This directory stores metadata about the project, which is used to identify the project when deploying to Globe.

## Unlinking Multiple Projects (e.g., Mono-Repos)
In multi-project setups, the unlink command allows you to select which project to unlink from the workspace.

Run the same command in your workspace directory:
```bash
globe unlink
```

The CLI displays a list of linked projects for you to select:
```bash
🔺 Select project:  
❯ ◉  blog-backend-369d  
  ◯  blog-frontend  
``` 

### Examples
```bash
globe unlink --project="blog-frontend"  
```

```bash
globe unlink --project="blog-backend-369d"  
```

Alternatively, you can select a project interactively:

```bash
 ~/Projects/OpenSource/dart-blog | on main >1 !3 ?1  globe unlink  
🔺 Select project:  
❯ ◉  blog-backend-369d  
  ◯  blog-frontend  
  ```
