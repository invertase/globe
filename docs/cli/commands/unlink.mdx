title: Unlink a project from Globe
---

The `unlink` command removes any previously linked projects from the current local project. This will prevent you from deploying the project to Globe.

## Usage

```bash
globe unlink
```

## How it works

The command removes the `.dart_tool/dart_globe` directory from the local project. This directory stores metadata about the project, which is used to identify the project when deploying to Globe.
