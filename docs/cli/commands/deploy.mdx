# Deploy

The `deploy` command allows you to deploy your Dart application to Globe directly from the command line.

If you have not yet [linked a project](/cli/commands/link), you will be prompted to do so before deploying.

## Usage

To deploy a project, run the following command from your Dart project root directory.

```bash
globe deploy
```

The CLI will upload your project to Globe and trigger a new deployment. Upon success, you will provided a URL to view deployment progress on the Globe dashboard.

By default, deployments via the `deploy` command are treated as a preview deployment. This means that once deployed, the deployment will have its own unique URL generated by Globe.
To deploy as a production deployment, append the `--prod` flag to the command.

```bash
globe deploy --prod
```

When successfully built, the deployment will be promoted to production and will be accessible via the project's primary domain(s).

You can learn more about [preview and production deployments](/deployments) in the deployments documentation.

### Flags

The command has flags (in addition to [global flags](/cli#global-flags)) that can be used to modify the behavior of the command, which can be accessed by running `globe deploy --<flag>`:

- `--prod` - Creates a deployment that will be promoted to production once built.
