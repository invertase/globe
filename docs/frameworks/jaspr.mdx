# Deploying a Dart Frog application

[Jaspr](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr) is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart with support for both client-side and server-side rendering.

Follow the [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr#get-started) for assistance with installing the Jaspr CLI.

## Create a new project

Create a new Dart Frog project by running the following command:

```bash
jaspr create my_jaspr_app
```

Start a local development server with the following command:

```bash
dart run jaspr serve
```

## Deploying to Globe

Before deploying your application to Globe, ensure you have the Server Side Rendering disabled flag disabled in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
jaspr:
  uses-ssr: false
```

This will enable Globe to build and serve your application instead. Globe will detect Jaspr is being used and automatically select it as a framework preset on your project settings. No additional steps are required.
