Jaspr is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart. Globe supports deploying Jaspr applications in all its [rendering modes](https://docs.jaspr.site/get_started/modes). This page outlines requirements and deployment behavior.

## Project Setup

To create a new Jaspr project:

1. Install the Jaspr CLI:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
   ```

2. Create a new Jaspr project, specifying your chosen rendering mode (`server`, `static`, or `client`):

   ```bash
   jaspr create my_jaspr_app
   cd my_jaspr_app
   ```

3. Test your application locally:

   ```bash
   jaspr serve
   ```

## Deploying to Globe

1. Run the deployment command from your project root:

   ```bash
   globe deploy --prod
   ```

2. For first-time deployments:

   - Confirm setup when prompted (press Y)
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., my-jaspr-app)
   - Choose the Dart entry point (e.g., `lib/main.dart`)

3. Wait for the deployment to complete. You'll receive a unique URL for accessing your web application.

## Viewing your application

Once deployed, your app is available at the unique URL shown in your dashboard (e.g., https://my-jaspr-app.globeapp.dev).

## Jaspr vs Flutter Web

Jaspr is best suited for building static websites, server-rendered, or single page apps using Dart with native web technologies (HTML, DOM, CSS). It brings a Flutter-like structure but embraces the web's natural rendering model.

Flutter Web, in contrast, is optimized for building cross-platform apps and paints UI via a canvas, which may not align well with document-centric or content-heavy websites.
