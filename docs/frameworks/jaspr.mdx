title: Deploying a Jaspr Application
---

Jaspr is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart. Globe supports the deployment of Jaspr applications in all its [rendering modes](https://docs.jaspr.site/get_started/modes).

This page outlines the requirements and deployment behaviour when deploying a Jaspr application to Globe.

## Project Setup

To create a new Jaspr project:

1.  Install the Jaspr CLI:

    ```bash
    dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
    ```

2.  Create a new Jaspr project, specifying your chosen rendering mode (`server`, `static`, or `client`):

    ```bash
    # For server-side rendering
    jaspr create -m server my_jaspr_app

    # For a static site
    jaspr create -m static my_jaspr_app

    # For client-side rendering
    jaspr create -m client my_jaspr_app

    cd my_jaspr_app
    ```

3.  Test your application locally:

    ```bash
    jaspr serve
    ```

## Deploying to Globe

1. Run the deployment command from your project root:

   ```bash
   globe deploy --prod
   ```

2. For first-time deployments:

   - Confirm setup when prompted (press Y)
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., my-jaspr-app)
   - Choose the Dart entry point (e.g., `lib/main.dart`)

3. Wait for the deployment to complete. You'll receive a unique URL for accessing your web application.

## Viewing your application

Once deployed, your app is available at the unique URL shown in your dashboard (e.g., https://my-jaspr-app.globeapp.dev).

## Deployment Behaviour

Globe builds your Jaspr project and deploys the output based on its configured mode.

- **Preset Detection**: Jaspr projects are automatically recognized.
- **Build Process**: Globe tailors the build based on the `mode` in `pubspec.yaml`:
  - `server`: Builds and deploys a Dart server application.
  - `static`: Generates a static site (HTML, CSS, JS) and deploys it to Globe's CDN.
  - `client`: Compiles a client-side application and deploys the static assets to Globe's CDN.

## Jaspr vs Flutter Web

Jaspr is best suited for building **static websites**, **server-rendered**, or **single page apps** using Dart with native web technologies (HTML, DOM, CSS). It brings a Flutter-like structure but embraces the webâ€™s natural rendering model.
Flutter Web, in contrast, is optimized for building **cross-platform apps** and paints UI via a canvas, which may not align well with **document-centric** or **content-heavy websites**.
