title: Deploying a Jaspr Application
---

Jaspr is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart. It supports both **client-side** and **server-side** rendering. Globe currently only supports the deployment of **server-side rendered (SSR)** Jaspr applications.

This page outlines the requirements and deployment behaviour when deploying a Jaspr application to Globe.

## Project Setup

To create a new Jaspr project:

1.  Install the Jaspr CLI:

    ```bash
    dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
    ```

2.  Create a new Jaspr project with the server-side rendering preset:

    ```bash
    jaspr create -m server:auto my_jaspr_app
    cd my_jaspr_app
    ```

3.  (Optional) If you have an existing project, ensure it is configured for server mode in your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```bash
    jaspr:
      mode: server
    ```

4.  Test your application locally:

    ```bash
    jaspr serve
    ```

## Deploying to Globe

Run the deployment command from your project root:

```bash
globe deploy
```

<Info>
  Globe automatically detects Jaspr applications and applies the correct
  framework preset during deployment. Your project must be in **server-side
  rendering mode** to deploy successfully.
</Info>

## Deployment Behaviour

- **Rendering**: Only **SSR** is supported at this time. Client-side mode is not currently compatible with Globe.
- **Preset detection**: Globe identifies Jaspr projects automatically.
- **Build**: The server-rendered app is built and deployed without additional configuration.
- **Status**: Client-side Jaspr applications are not yet supported, but we plan to add compatibility soon.

## Jaspr vs Flutter Web

Jaspr is best suited for building **static websites**, **server-rendered**, or **single page apps** using Dart with native web technologies (HTML, DOM, CSS). It brings a Flutter-like structure but embraces the webâ€™s natural rendering model.
Flutter Web, in contrast, is optimized for building **cross-platform apps** and paints UI via a canvas, which may not align well with **document-centric** or **content-heavy websites**.
