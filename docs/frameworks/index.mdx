title: Frameworks
---

Globe aims to be framework agnostic and hence you can deploy any frameworks that does not have additional build steps. If the framework that you are using does not require such additional steps, then it is already supported by Globe. There is auto detection for `build_runner` and `melos`, so these are already covered by the Globe system. In addition, you can also set a custom build command for your project.

Some frameworks have additional steps like build commands that need to be run before deployment. Globe supports these frameworks by automatically providing default build settings for each framework that can be used to build and deploy your application.

## Framework Presets

Ongoing work is being done to support more frameworks. If you'd like to see a framework supported please submit a [feature request](https://invertase.canny.io/globe).
