# Frameworks

Globe aims to be framework agnostic, however, some frameworks have additional steps like build commands that need to be run before deployment. Globe supports these frameworks by automatically providing default build settings for each framework that can be used to build and deploy your application.

## Supported Frameworks

Ongoing work is being done to support more frameworks. If you'd like to see a framework supported please submit a [feature request](https://invertase.canny.io/globe).
