description: Learn about supported Dart and Flutter frameworks on Globe, including Dart Frog, Shelf, Flutter Web, and Jaspr with automatic preset detection.
---

Globe is **framework-agnostic** and supports **any Dart-based project** that can be built **without additional tooling**. If your framework does not require extra setup or custom build steps, it will work on Globe by default.

For supported frameworks with specific build requirements, Globe applies **preconfigured framework presets** that automatically detect and run the necessary build commands. This includes support for tools like `build_runner` and `melos`.

You can also configure a custom build command for frameworks not yet supported by presets.

## Supported frameworks

Globe currently includes presets for:

- [Dart Shelf](/frameworks/shelf-server): Minimal HTTP server framework for Dart
- [Dart Frog](/frameworks/dart-frog): File system-based routing framework for Dart
- [Flutter Web](/frameworks/flutter-web): Frontend framework for building SPAs and web applications
- [Jaspr](/frameworks/jaspr): Modern web framework for building websites in Dart
- [Serverpod](/frameworks/serverpod): Full-stack framework for building scalable server applications with Flutter clients
- [Monorepo](/frameworks/monorepos): Deploy Dart applications from monorepos and workspaces managed by Melos or Pub Workspaces

More frameworks are in progress. To request support for a specific framework, [submit a feature request](https://invertase.canny.io/globe).
