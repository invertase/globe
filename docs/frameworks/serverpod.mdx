title: Deploying a Serverpod Application
description: Deploy Serverpod applications to Globe with database configuration and support for both server and Flutter client deployments.
---

Serverpod is a full-stack framework for building scalable server applications in Dart. It includes a server component and a Flutter client library. Globe supports deploying both the Serverpod server and Flutter client applications. This page outlines requirements and deployment behavior.

## Project Setup

To create a new Serverpod project:

1. Install the Serverpod CLI:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate serverpod_cli
   ```

2. Create a new Serverpod project:

   ```bash
   serverpod create my_serverpod_app
   cd my_serverpod_app
   ```

3. Test your server locally:

   ```bash
   cd my_serverpod_app_server
   dart run bin/main.dart
   ```

<Info>
  Serverpod creates directories with your project name as a prefix. For a
  project named `my_serverpod_app`, the directories will be
  `my_serverpod_app_server` and `my_serverpod_app_flutter`.
</Info>

## Database Requirements

Serverpod requires a PostgreSQL database. Compatible providers include [Neon](https://neon.tech), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or any PostgreSQL service.

Required connection details:

- **Host**: Database host URL
- **Database name**: Name of the database
- **User**: Database username
- **Password**: Database password (configured as environment variable)

## Configuration

Database connection details are stored in Serverpod's configuration files located in `my_serverpod_app_server/config/`.

Example `config/production.yaml`:

```yaml
database:
  host: your-database-host
  name: your-database-name
  user: your-database-username
  # password is injected via SERVERPOD_DATABASE_PASSWORD environment variable
```

The `staging.yaml` file can be configured with separate staging database credentials.

<Info>
  Database passwords are not stored in configuration files. They are injected at
  runtime via environment variables.
</Info>

## Environment Variables

Serverpod deployments require the following environment variables:

### Server

| Variable                      | Description                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `SERVERPOD_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL database password |

### Flutter Client

| Variable     | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER_URL` | Deployed server URL (include trailing slash) |

Different values can be configured for preview and production environments. See [Environment Variables](/core-concepts/environment-variables) for configuration details.

## Deploying to Globe

Serverpod projects contain two deployable components that are linked and deployed separately.

### Server Deployment

1. From the project root directory, link the server project:

   ```bash
   globe link
   ```

2. Select `my_serverpod_app_server` as the root directory when prompted

3. Configure the `SERVERPOD_DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable in the Globe dashboard

4. Deploy to production:

   ```bash
   globe deploy --prod
   ```

The deployment URL (e.g., `https://my-serverpod-server.globeapp.dev/`) is required for the Flutter client configuration.

### Flutter Client Deployment

1. From the project root directory, link the Flutter project:

   ```bash
   globe link
   ```

2. Select `my_serverpod_app_flutter` as the root directory when prompted

3. Configure the `SERVER_URL` environment variable with the deployed server URL (include trailing slash)

4. Deploy to production:

   ```bash
   globe deploy --prod
   ```

## Deployment Behavior

Globe handles Serverpod deployments with the following behavior:

- **Preset detection**: Serverpod server projects are automatically recognized as Dart backend applications
- **Database configuration**: Connection details are read from `config/production.yaml` with passwords injected via environment variables
- **Flutter client**: Deployed as a standard Flutter Web application to Globe's CDN
- **Multi-project structure**: Each component (server, Flutter client) is linked and deployed as a separate Globe project
