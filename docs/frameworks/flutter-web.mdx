title: Flutter Web
---

To deploy a Flutter Web Application, you can add it via the [Github Integration](/deployments/github-integration) or if you use the CLI, you can run the following command in the root of the project: 

```bash
globe deploy
```

Globe will automatically apply the correct preset and deploy your application. The build system will auto-detect `build_runner` if used and runs it during the building stage of the deployment.

For a more detailed example, [click here](/getting-started/flutter-web).

## How it works

Globe builds your Flutter Application for the Web and uploads the built files to our globally distributed CDN network. Hence, your application is always served from a location nearest to the user thus reducing latency and improving load times.

## Automatic Optimizations

Globe hashes your assets and applies filename fingerprinting to vastly improve cache performance. This also ensures your files are correctly updated by the browser for every new deployment.
