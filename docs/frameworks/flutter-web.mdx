title: Deploying a Flutter Web Application
---

Deploying Flutter Web on Globe enables you to host high-performance single-page applications (SPAs) globally with minimal setup. Globe detects Flutter projects automatically and applies optimized defaults for build, deploy, and caching. This page outlines requirements and deployment behaviour.

## Project Setup

To create a new Flutter Web project:

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   flutter create my_flutter_app
   cd my_flutter_app
   ```

2. Test your application locally with:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

## Deploying to Globe

1. Run the deployment command from your project root:

   ```bash
   globe deploy
   ```

2. For first-time deployments:

   - Confirm setup when prompted (press Y)
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., my-flutter-app)
   - Accept the detected Flutter preset when prompted

3. Wait for the deployment to complete. You'll receive a unique URL for accessing your web application.

## Viewing your application

Once deployed, your app is available at the unique URL shown in your dashboard (e.g., https://my-flutter-app.globeapp.dev). Reloading the page or opening in multiple tabs will show the same consistent deployment state.

## Deployment Behaviour

Globe builds your Flutter Web project and uploads the compiled output (build/web) to its CDN network.

- **Preset detection**: Flutter Web projects are automatically recognized.
- **Environment**: No manual configuration required.
- **Build runner**: If used, it is auto-detected and executed before deployment.
- **Asset handling**:
  - Assets are hashed and fingerprinted for cache optimization.
  - Base href is automatically set to /.

## Best practices

- Use responsive design principles for optimal display across different devices.
- Test your application across multiple browsers before deployment.
- Consider using web-specific optimizations like lazy loading for better performance.
