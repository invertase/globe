title: Deploying a Dart Frog Application
---

Dart Frog is a fast, minimalistic backend framework for Dart built on top of Shelf. It provides file-based routing, middleware support, and dependency injection for building efficient backend services. Globe automatically detects Dart Frog projects and applies the appropriate build and deployment settings. This page outlines requirements and deployment behaviour.

## Project Setup

To create a new project using the Globe template:

```bash
globe create -t crud_rest_api_dartfrog
```

To create a Shelf project manually:

1. Install the Dart Frog CLI:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli
   ```

2. Create a new Dart Frog project:

   ```bash
   dart_frog create my_dart_frog_app
   cd my_dart_frog_app
   ```

3. Test your application locally:
   ```bash
   dart_frog dev
   ```

## Deploying to Globe

Run the deployment command from your project root:

```bash
globe deploy
```

<Info>
  Globe automatically detects Dart Frog applications and applies the correct
  framework preset during deployment. No additional configuration is required.

## How it works

Dart Frog uses a file-system-based routing approach:

- **Routing**: Dart Frog uses file-system-based routing. Files in the routes/ directory define endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Add interceptors for requests/responses via middleware files.
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies into handlers using the request context.
- **Preset detection**: Globe recognizes Dart Frog projects and handles all configs automatically.

## Best practices

- Organize routes logically following REST API conventions for better maintainability.
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging.
- Leverage dependency injection for configurable and testable services.
- Always listen to the PORT environment variable for Globe compatibility.
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.
