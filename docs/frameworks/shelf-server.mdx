title: Deploying a Shelf Server
---

Shelf is a flexible web server framework for Dart. Globe supports deploying Shelf applications with zero custom configuration. This page outlines requirements and deployment behaviour.

## Project Setup

To create a new project using the Globe template, run the following command:

```bash
globe create â€“t crud_rest_api_shelf
```

To create a Shelf project manually

1. Create a basic Dart application:

   ```bash
   dart create my_shelf_app
   ```

2. Rename `lib/my_shelf_app.dart` to `lib/main.dart` for the application entry point

3. Install the Shelf package:

   ```bash
   dart pub add shelf
   ```

4. Copy this code into lib/main.dart:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';
   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
   import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as shelf_io;

   void main() async {
     final handler =
         const Pipeline().addMiddleware(logRequests()).addHandler(_echoRequest);

     final server = await shelf_io.serve(
       handler,
       InternetAddress.anyIPv4,
       int.tryParse(Platform.environment['PORT'] ?? '8080') ?? 8080,
     );

     print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
   }

   Response _echoRequest(Request request) =>
       Response.ok('Request for "${request.url}"... worked!');
   ```

   <Info>
     For Globe to correctly run your backend application, it must listen to the
     `PORT` environment variable as shown in the example.
   </Info>

5. Test your application locally:

   ```bash
   dart run lib/main.dart
   ```

6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/hello` in your browser to see: `Request for "hello"... worked!`

## Deploying to Globe

1. Run the deployment command from your project root:

   ```bash
   globe deploy
   ```

2. For first-time deployments:

   - Confirm setup when prompted (press Y)
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., my-shelf-app) or accept the default

3. Wait for the deployment to complete. You'll receive a unique URL for accessing your deployment.

## Deployment Behaviour

- **Environment**: Globe sets the `PORT` variable automatically. Your app must listen to it.
- **Build runner**: Detected and triggered based on Dart project structure.
- **Preset**: No config needed for Shelf; Globe uses sensible defaults.
- **Logs**: Real-time logs are available in the dashboard under the **Logs** tab.

## Best practices

- Always listen on the `PORT` environment variable with a fallback for local development.
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Use middleware for **logging**, **authentication**, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- Separate route handlers into dedicated files for better maintainability.
- Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
