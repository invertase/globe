---

Globe AI is a Dart-first SDK for integrating large language models (LLMs) into Dart and Flutter apps. It supports text generation, streaming responses, and structured data extraction.

It is ideal for building AI-powered features, generating creative text, extracting information from documents, and validating structured data output against a schema.

This page covers setup, generating text, streaming responses, and working with structured data.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate text from a simple prompt or a series of messages, including multimodal inputs like images and documents
- **Streaming**: Stream text or structured data responses as they are generated for a real-time user experience
- **Structured Output**: Reliably generate structured JSON output that is validated against a custom schema
- **Model Agnostic**: Easily configure your preferred model provider, like OpenAI

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Globe Runtime

First, you need the Globe Runtime. You can install it using one of two methods:

- **With the Globe CLI**: If you have the Globe CLI installed, simply run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  globe runtime install
  ```

- **Manual Installation**: Download the `libglobe_runtime` dynamic library for your platform from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/invertase/globe_runtime/releases). Place the downloaded file into the `~/.globe/runtime/` directory.

### 2. Add `globe_ai` to Your Project

Add the `globe_ai` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  globe_ai: ^<latest-version>
```

Then, run the appropriate command to install it:

- With Dart:

  ```bash
  dart pub get
  ```

- With Flutter:

  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  ```

### 3. Configure Your Model

Create an instance of your chosen model provider. For example, to use OpenAI, you can configure it like this:

```dart
import 'package:globe_ai/globe_ai.dart';

// Configure the model, e.g., OpenAI's 'gpt-4o'
// The 'user' parameter is optional and can be used for tracking or moderation.
final model = openai.chat('gpt-4o', user: 'John');

// Or for a simpler configuration:
final model = openai('gpt-4o');
```

## Usage

Globe AI provides powerful tools for interacting with LLMs.

### Text Generation

Generate a complete text response from a single prompt or a series of messages.

#### Basic Text Generation

```dart
final result = await generateText(
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'What is the capital of Ghana?',
);

print(result); // Output: Accra
```

#### Generation with Multimodal Input

You can also send a combination of text and files (like PDFs or images) as input.

```dart
final textWithPdf = await generateText(
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4o'),
  messages: [
    OpenAIMessage(
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        OpenAIInput(text: 'What is the title of this book?'),
        OpenAIInput(
          file: FileInput(
            data: File('path/to/your/doc.pdf').readAsBytesSync(),
            mimeType: 'application/pdf',
            name: 'ai.pdf',
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
);

print(textWithPdf);
```

### Streaming Text

For a more responsive user experience, stream the response as it's being generated by the model. This is great for chatbots or displaying long-form text.

```dart
final stream = streamText(
  model: openai('o4-mini'),
  prompt: 'Describe the Mission burrito vs SF burrito debate.',
);

await for (final chunk in stream) {
  // Each 'chunk' is a piece of the response
  stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Structured Object Generation

Ensure you get reliable, machine-readable output by generating JSON that is validated against a schema. This is perfect for when you need a specific data structure.

To define the structure of your JSON output, Globe AI uses Luthor, a powerful data validation library that is bundled directly into the `globe_ai` package. You can access its functions through the `l` object.

Luthor allows you to define a schema that the AI's output will be validated against, ensuring you always get the data structure you expect. For more detailed information on creating schemas and using all available validators, please refer to the official [Luthor documentation](https://luthor.netlify.app/).

#### 1. Define Your Schema

First, define the shape of the JSON you expect using `l.schema`.

```dart
final schema = l.schema({
  'recipe': l.schema({
    'name': l.string(),
    'ingredients': l.list(validators: [
      l.schema({'name': l.string(), 'amount': l.string()}),
    ]),
    'steps': l.list(validators: [l.string()]),
  })
});
```

#### 2. Generate the Object

Then, call `generateObject` with your prompt and schema.

```dart
final result = await generateObject<Map<String, dynamic>>(
  model: openai('gpt-4.1'),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
  schema: schema,
);

// Safely access the validated data
print(result['recipe']['name']); // e.g., 'Classic Lasagna'
```

### Streaming Structured Objects

Combine the power of streaming and structured data. This feature allows you to stream a JSON object and validate its structure incrementally.

```dart
final resultStream = streamObject<Map<String, dynamic>>(
  model: openai('gpt-4.1'),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
  schema: schema,
);

await for (final chunk in resultStream) {
  // 'chunk' is a validated partial output of your object
  print(chunk);
}
```
