title: Globe DB
description: Use Globe DB, a serverless SQLite database for Dart and Flutter, with edge-ready performance and seamless integration with popular Dart database packages.
---

Globe DB is a serverless SQLite database built for Dart and Flutter developers. It combines the simplicity and familiarity of SQLite with the power of the cloud, zero configuration, no learning curve, and built for performance at the edge.

<Warning>
  Globe DB is currently in Beta. While the core protocol compatibility and
  proxy components are stable, internal APIs and network behavior may change. We
  welcome your [feedback](https://invertase.canny.io/globe) during this period.
</Warning>

## Key Features

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Edge-Ready, Serverless" icon="bolt">
    All SQL commands are proxied to `LibSQL` over the network, either via HTTP
    or WebSockets. This enables truly serverless SQLite from the edge, with zero
    local data storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dart-First Experience" icon="code">
    Built with Dart and Flutter in mind. Works seamlessly with existing Dart
    packages like `Drift ORM` and `sqlite3`, supporting both local development
    and edge deployment.
