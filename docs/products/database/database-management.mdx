## Interacting with Data

The Globe dashboard integrates **Outerbase Studio**, allowing you to directly query, edit, and manage your data. To open the studio, click on a database name from your list.

The studio allows you to:

- **Browse** the schema, tables, and rows.
- **Query** your data by writing and executing raw SQL.
- **Edit** data by inserting, updating, or deleting rows.

## Connecting from External Tools

You can connect to your Globe DB from any client that supports the LibSQL protocol.

To find your credentials:

1. From the **database** list, click the menu icon (⋮) next to the database name.
2. Select **Connect to database** from the menu.
3. Scroll to the **Connect using any LibSQL Client** section to find your URL and generate a token.

## Deleting a Database

Deleting a database is an irreversible action and will permanently erase all of its data.

1. From the database list, click the menu icon (⋮) next to the database name.
2. Select the _Delete_ option.
3. Confirm the action by typing the name of the database.

## Database Limits

Projects on the free tier have the following limits:

- **Two active databases** per project.
- **1GB of storage** per database.

To create a new database when at your limit, you must first delete an existing one.
