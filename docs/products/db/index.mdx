title: Globe DB
---

Globe DB is a **distributed, serverless database service** built for Dart and Flutter developers. It combines the **simplicity and familiarity of SQLite** with a globally distributed network, allowing you to create fast, modern applications with zero infrastructure management and the Dart tools you already know.

## How It Works

Globe DB is designed to provide **a seamless workflow** between local development and cloud deployment, eliminating the need for traditional database connection management.

The process is designed to be transparent, requiring no code changes when moving from your local machine to production.

- **Local Development**: You write your backend application using a standard Dart ORM like Drift. When you run your server locally, Drift connects to a regular file on your machine (e.g., my-first-db.db), allowing for fast and simple testing.

- **Deploy to Globe**: When you deploy your application, the Globe platform detects this file-based connection and transparently redirects all database operations to your provisioned, live Globe DB.

The result is that the exact same code works in both environments, abstracting away the complexity of managing different database configurations.

  <Card title="Serverless SQLite" icon="server">
    You get the benefits of the world's most popular database engine without
    managing servers. We handle the scaling, replication, and maintenance so you
    can focus on building features.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Familiar Dart Tooling" icon="code">
    There's no custom SDK to learn. Globe DB works seamlessly with the Dart
    tools you already know, like the Drift ORM. Write your database code in
    type-safe Dart, test it locally, and deploy to the edge without changing a
    line.

  <Card title="Global Low-Latency" icon="globe">
    Your database is automatically distributed worldwide, ensuring fast data
    access for users in locations like Abuja, London, and Tokyo, as they read
    from a nearby database replica.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Portability" icon="unlock">
    Globe DB uses the standard SQLite format, so your data is always yours. You
    can easily export your database and run it anywhere, from a local machine to
    another cloud provider, without being locked into a proprietary system.
