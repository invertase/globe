title: Globe DB
---

Globe DB is a **serverless SQLite-compatible database** built for Dart and Flutter developers. It combines the **simplicity and familiarity of SQLite** with the power of the cloud, zero configuration, no learning curve, and built for performance at the edge.

<Warning>
  Globe DB is currently in **Beta**. While the core protocol compatibility and
  proxy components are stable, internal APIs and network behavior may change.
  Feedback is highly encouraged.

## Key Features

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Edge-Ready, Serverless" icon="bolt">
    All SQL commands are proxied to `LibSQL` over the network, either via HTTP
    or WebSockets. This enables truly serverless SQLite from the edge, with zero
    local data storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dart-First Experience" icon="code">
    Built with Dart and Flutter in mind. Works seamlessly with existing Dart
    packages like `Drift ORM` and `sqlite3`, supporting both local development
    and edge deployment.
