title: Globe DB
---

Globe DB is a **distributed, serverless database service** built for Dart and Flutter developers. It combines the **simplicity and familiarity of SQLite** with a globally distributed network, allowing you to create fast, modern applications with zero infrastructure management and the Dart tools you already know.

<Warning>
  Globe DB is currently in Beta. The core functionality is stable, but we may
  introduce breaking changes to the API or platform in the future. We welcome
  your feedback during this period.

## Key Features

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Serverless SQLite" icon="server">
    You get the benefits of the world's most popular database engine without
    managing servers. We handle the scaling, replication, and maintenance so you
    can focus on building features.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Familiar Dart Tooling" icon="code">
    There's no custom SDK to learn. Globe DB works seamlessly with the Dart
    tools you already know, like the Drift ORM. Write your database code in
    type-safe Dart, test it locally, and deploy to the edge without changing a
    line.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Low-Latency" icon="globe">
    Your database is automatically distributed worldwide, ensuring fast data
    access for users in locations like Abuja, London, and Tokyo, as they read
    from a nearby database replica.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Portability" icon="unlock">
    Globe DB uses the standard SQLite format, so your data is always yours. You
    can easily export your database and run it anywhere, from a local machine to
    another cloud provider, without being locked into a proprietary system.
