title: The Distributed Edge
---

Globe DB is a **distributed database**. Instead of storing your data in a single, central location, it's replicated across multiple servers in various geographic regions. This architecture is designed to solve one of the biggest challenges for modern applications: **network latency**.

## The Problem: The Speed of Light is Slow

When a user's device sends a request to a database, the physical distance that request has to travel is a major factor in how fast the application feels. If your database is in Virginia, USA, a user in Lagos will always experience a noticeable delay as their request travels across the Atlantic and back. For data-intensive applications, this latency can make the user experience feel sluggish.

## The Solution: Move Data Closer to Your Users

Globe DB solves this by placing read replicas of your database in locations around the globe. When a user in Lagos queries your database, their request doesn't travel to Virginia. Instead, it's automatically routed to the nearest replica, for example, one in **South Africa**.

This dramatically reduces the travel time for the data, resulting in significantly faster read queries and a much snappier user experience for your global user base. Globe DB manages this replication for you automatically, with zero configuration required.

## Key Benefits

- **Faster App Performance**: Users experience quicker data loading times, regardless of where they are in the world.
- **Improved User Experience**: A responsive, low-latency application leads to higher user satisfaction and engagement.
- **Zero Configuration**: You don't need to manually configure or manage replicas; the Globe platform handles the entire distribution process for you.
