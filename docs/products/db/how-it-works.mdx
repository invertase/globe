title: How Globe DB Works
---

Globe DB is designed to provide a seamless workflow between local development and cloud deployment, eliminating the need for traditional database connection management. The core principle is simple: you write your database code once, and it works everywhere.

## The Local-to-Remote Workflow

The process is transparent and requires no code changes when moving from your local machine to production.

### Develop Locally

You write your backend application using a standard Dart ORM like Drift. When you run your server locally, Drift connects to a regular file on your machine (e.g., `my-first-db.db`). This allows you to build and test your application with the speed and simplicity of a local SQLite database.

### Deploy to the Cloud

When you deploy your application, the Globe platform intelligently detects this file-based connection. Instead of creating a local file, it transparently redirects all database operations to your provisioned, live Globe DB.

The result is that the exact same code communicates with your globally distributed database, abstracting away the complexity of managing different environments and connection strings.

  The connection between your local code and the live database is handled
  automatically by the Globe deployment process. A detailed technical
  explanation will be added to this page soon.
