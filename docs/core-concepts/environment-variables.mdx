title: Environment Variables
description: Manage secrets and environment-specific configuration for your Globe deployments using environment variables, with support for preview and production environments.
---

Environment variables let you **manage secrets** and **environment-specific** configuration without hardcoding values in your app. Use them to store API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive or environment-specific settings securely.

## Why Use Environment Variables?

Environment variables help you:

- Keep secrets like **API keys**, **tokens**, or **credentials** out of your source code
- Customize behavior for different deployment environments (e.g., **development**, **staging**, **production**)
- Collaborate securely with teams across versions and environments
- Automate deploys without hardcoding sensitive values

<Warning>
  Store sensitive values in environment variables, not in source code or
  comments.
</Warning>

## How to Create Environment Variables

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open **Settings → Environment Variables**
3. Select **Add Variable**
4. Enter a **name** and **value**
5. Choose environments: `preview`, `production`, or both
6. Select **Save**

<Info>
  All values are encrypted at rest and can only be viewed directly through the
  dashboard. You’ll need to redeploy your project for changes to environment
  variables to take effect.
</Info>

## How to Access Environment Variables in Dart

### Using Dart’s `Platform.environment` map

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  final apiKey = Platform.environment['API_KEY'];

  if (apiKey != null) {
    print('API Key: $apiKey');
  } else {
    print('API Key not found!');
  }
}
```

### Using the dotenv Package

In development, use a .env file locally and the dotenv package to load environment variables while still respecting platform variables in deployment.

```dart
import 'package:dotenv/dotenv.dart';

void main() {
  final env = DotEnv(includePlatformEnvironment: true)..load();

  final apiKey = env['API_KEY'];
  print('API Key: $apiKey');
}
```

<Warning>
  Static files like .env are ignored during deployment. Always pass
  `includePlatformEnvironment: true` to ensure your deployed app can access your
  defined environment variables.
</Warning>

## How to Use Environment Variables with Flutter Web

Flutter Web requires build-time variables via the `--dart-define` flag, as runtime access with `Platform.environment` is unavailable.

Globe automates this process for the Flutter preset. The build system reads all project **Environment Variables** for a deployment and appends them as `--dart-define=VARIABLE_NAME=value` flags to the `flutter build web` command.

### How to Access Variables in Flutter Web

You can then access these compiled-in variables in your Dart code using `String.fromEnvironment`:

```dart
class AppConfig {
  static const supabaseUrl = String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_URL');
  static const supabaseAnonKey = String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');
}
```

## Globe’s System Environment Variables

Globe automatically provides these system environment variables in all deployments:

| Name              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`            | The port your application should listen on                   |
| `GLOBE`           | Set to `'1'` to indicate app running in Globe                |
| `GLOBE_BUILD_ENV` | Set to `'1'` when code is running in Globe Build Environment |
| `HOSTNAME`        | The hostname of your deployed application                    |
| `CRON_NAME`       | Name of the cron job from `globe.yaml` file                  |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE`   | The cron schedule pattern (e.g., `* * * * *`)                |
| `CRON_ID`         | Unique identifier for the defined cron job                   |
| `CRON_EVENT_ID`   | Unique identifier for the current running cron instance      |

<Info>
  Cron environment variables are only available when a cron job is running.
</Info>

### Detecting Globe Environment

Use the `GLOBE` variable to check if your application is running in Globe:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  final isGlobe = Platform.environment['GLOBE'] == '1';

  if (isGlobe) {
    // Running in Globe - use production configuration
    print('Running in Globe environment');
  } else {
    // Running locally - use development configuration
    print('Running in local environment');
  }
}
```

### Using `GLOBE_BUILD_ENV` for Pre-Deployment Tasks

The `GLOBE_BUILD_ENV` variable allows you to run migrations and other pre-deployment checks during the build phase, before your application starts serving traffic. This helps avoid slow startup times at runtime.

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  final isBuildEnv = Platform.environment['GLOBE_BUILD_ENV'] == '1';

  if (isBuildEnv) {
    stdout.writeln('Running in build environment, setting up DB.');
    // Run database migrations
    await migrations.migrate(db);
    // Perform other pre-deployment setup
  }

  // Your application code continues here
}
```

Running migrations and setup tasks during build time rather than at runtime helps improve application startup speed.

## Important Considerations

- **Environment-Specific Variables**: Configure variables to appear only in specific environments (**preview**, **production**, or both)
- **Redeployment Required**: After adding, changing, or removing variables, redeploy your project for changes to take effect
- **Encrypted Storage**: All variable values are encrypted at rest and in transit
- **No Version History**: Globe doesn't maintain history of variable values; document important changes

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive variable names like `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, or `DB_URL`
- Never commit sensitive values to your code repository; even in comments
- Regularly review and rotate sensitive values like API keys
- Use different values for **preview** and **production** environments when appropriate
- Document required variables in your project’s **README**
