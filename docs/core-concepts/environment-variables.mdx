title: Environment Variables
---

Use environment variables to **manage secrets** and **environment-specific** config without hardcoding values in your app.

## Why Use Environment Variables?

Environment variables help you:

- Keep secrets like **API keys**, **tokens**, or **credentials** out of your source code
- Customize behavior for different deployment environments (e.g., **development**, **staging**, **production**)
- Collaborate securely with teams across versions and environments
- Automate deploys without hardcoding sensitive values

<Warning>
  Store sensitive values in environment variables, not in source code or
  comments.
</Warning>

## How to Create Environment Variables

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open **Settings → Environment Variables**
3. Select **Add Variable**
4. Enter a **name** and **value**
5. Choose environments: `preview`, `production`, or both
6. Select **Save**

<Info>
  All values are encrypted at rest and can only be viewed directly through the
  dashboard. You’ll need to redeploy your project for changes to environment
  variables to take effect.
</Info>

## How to Access Environment Variables in Dart

### Using Dart’s `Platform.environment` map

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  final apiKey = Platform.environment['API_KEY'];

  if (apiKey != null) {
    print('API Key: $apiKey');
  } else {
    print('API Key not found!');
  }
}
```

### Using the dotenv Package

In development, use a .env file locally and the dotenv package to load environment variables while still respecting platform variables in deployment.

```dart
import 'package:dotenv/dotenv.dart';

void main() {
  final env = DotEnv(includePlatformEnvironment: true)..load();

  final apiKey = env['API_KEY'];
  print('API Key: $apiKey');
}
```

<Warning>
  Static files like .env are ignored during deployment. Always pass
  `includePlatformEnvironment: true` to ensure your deployed app can access your
  defined environment variables.
</Warning>

## Globe’s System Environment Variables

Globe automatically provides these system environment variables in all deployments:

| Name            | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`          | The port your application should listen on              |
| `GLOBE`         | Set to `'1'` to indicate app running in Globe           |
| `HOSTNAME`      | The hostname of your deployed application               |
| `CRON_NAME`     | Name of the cron job from `globe.yaml` file             |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE` | The cron schedule pattern (e.g., `* * * * *`)           |
| `CRON_ID`       | Unique identifier for the defined cron job              |
| `CRON_EVENT_ID` | Unique identifier for the current running cron instance |

<Info>
  Cron environment variables are only available when a cron job is running.
</Info>

## Important Considerations

- **Environment-Specific Variables**: Configure variables to appear only in specific environments (**preview**, **production**, or both).
- **Redeployment Required**: After adding, changing, or removing variables, redeploy your project.
- **Encrypted Storage**: All variable values are encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **No Version History**: Globe doesn't maintain history of variable values; document important changes.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive variable names like `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, or `DB_URL`
- Never commit sensitive values to your code repository; even in comments
- Regularly review and rotate sensitive values like API keys
- Use different values for **preview** and **production** environments when appropriate
- Document required variables in your project’s **README**

Connect a **custom domain** to make your deployed app accessible at a **branded URL**.
