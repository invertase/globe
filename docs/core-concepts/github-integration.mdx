title: GitHub Integration
---

Connect your GitHub repository to **deploy automatically** from **pushes** and **merges**. It replaces manual deployment steps and keeps your workflow continuous.

### With GitHub integration, you can:

- Import a GitHub repository to create and deploy a new Globe project
- Automatically trigger deployments on every push
- Designate a production branch for live releases
- Connect existing Globe projects to GitHub
- Disconnect or switch repositories anytime
- View deployment status for each commit

<Info>
  Globe integrates with GitHub via the [GitHub
  Application](https://github.com/apps/dart-globe).

## How to Connect Your GitHub Repository

### 1. Authorize GitHub Access

- From the Globe dashboard, go to **Projects → Create Project**
- Select **Connect your GitHub account** and authorize the **Globe GitHub App**
- You'll be redirected back to the **Project Create** screen afterward

### 2. Choose Repositories

After authorizing the GitHub app, you will need to configure the repositories that are available to Globe:

- Select **Configure the GitHub app**.
- Select specific or all repositories you want Globe to access.
- You will be redirected to the **Project Create** screen.

### 3. Import & Configure

- Select **Import** next to the repo you want to use
- Configure the following:
  - **Import settings:** organization, name, root directory, branch
  - **Build settings:** framework preset, build command, entry point
  - **Build config:** SDK version, build runner, Melos
  - **Environment variables**
- Select **Deploy** to trigger the first deployment

From now on, every time you push to GitHub, Globe will automatically create a new deployment:

- For your production branch, a **production deployment** is created
- For all other branches, a **preview deployment** is triggered

## Connecting an Existing Project

If you've already deployed a project (e.g., via CLI):

1. Open the project → Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Select **Connect** and choose your repository
3. Set deployment configurations as needed

## Deployment Workflow

The GitHub integration enables automatic deployments based on your repository activity:

- **Preview Deployments:** Triggered by pushes to any branch _except_ your production branch
- **Production Deployments:** Triggered by pushes to your designated production branch
- **Commit Status:** Globe adds deployment status indicators to your GitHub commits

## Disconnecting a GitHub Repository

To stop automatic deployments:

1. Go to your project → **Settings → Git**
2. Select **Disconnect**

<Info>
  Disconnecting from GitHub will not delete existing deployments. It only stops
  new deployments from being triggered by Git pushes.
</Info>

### Best Practices

- Use a clear branching strategy (e.g., `main` for production, `dev` for testing)
- Protect your production branch if collaborating in teams
- Consider pairing this with the CLI for local preview builds
- Only connect necessary repositories for clarity and security — follow the principle of least privilege

## Next

Track **requests**, **resource usage**, and **performance** across projects and environments.
