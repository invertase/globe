description: Connect your GitHub repository to automatically deploy Dart and Flutter apps on every push, with support for production and preview deployments.
---

Connect your GitHub repository to **deploy automatically** from **pushes** and **merges**. GitHub integration replaces manual deployment steps and keeps your workflow continuous, enabling automatic deployments for both preview and production environments.

## With GitHub integration, you can:

- **Import a GitHub repository** to create and deploy a new Globe project
- **Automatically trigger deployments** on every push to any branch
- **Designate a production branch** for live releases
- **Connect existing Globe projects** to GitHub repositories
- **Disconnect or switch repositories** anytime
- **View deployment status** for each commit

<Info>
  Globe integrates with GitHub via the [GitHub
  Application](https://github.com/apps/dart-globe).

## How to Create a Project from a GitHub Repository

Import a repository to create a new Globe project with automatic deployments enabled from the start.

### Step 1. Start Project Creation

From the Globe dashboard, go to **Projects → Create Project** and select **Import from GitHub**.

What you see next depends on whether your GitHub account is already connected:

- **Already connected?** You'll see a list of your repositories ready to import. Skip to Step 3.

- **Not connected yet?** You'll see a **Connect** button. Continue with Step 2.

### Step 2. Connect Your GitHub Account (if needed)

1. Select the **Connect** button to authorize the **Globe GitHub App**
2. You'll be redirected to GitHub to grant access
3. After authorization, you'll return to the **Project Create** screen

### Step 3. Choose Repositories

After authorizing the GitHub app, configure the repositories that are available to Globe:

1. Select **Configure the GitHub app**
2. Select specific or all repositories you want Globe to access
3. You will be redirected to the **Project Create** screen

### Step 4. Import & Configure

1. Select **Import** next to the repository you want to use
2. Configure the following:
   - **Import settings:** organization, name, root directory, branch
   - **Build settings:** framework preset, build command, entry point
   - **Build config:** SDK version, build runner, Melos
   - **Environment variables**
3. Select **Deploy** to trigger the first deployment

<Warning>
  Your project's root directory must contain a `pubspec.yaml` file.
</Warning>

From now on, every time you push to GitHub, Globe will automatically create a new deployment:

- For your production branch, a **production deployment** is created
- For all other branches, a **preview deployment** is triggered

## How to Connect a Repository to an Existing Project

If you've already deployed a project (e.g., via CLI) and want to connect it to a GitHub repository:

1. Open the project → Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Select **Connect** and choose your repository
3. Set deployment configurations as needed

<Image src="/assets/core-concepts/connect-git.png" />

Once connected, pushes to your GitHub repository will automatically trigger deployments for this project.

## How GitHub Integration Works

The GitHub integration enables automatic deployments based on your repository activity:

- **Preview Deployments:** Triggered by pushes to any branch except your production branch
- **Production Deployments:** Triggered by pushes to your designated production branch
- **Commit Status:** Globe adds deployment status indicators to your GitHub commits

## How to Disconnect a GitHub Repository

To stop automatic deployments:

1. Go to your project → **Settings → Git**
2. Select **Disconnect**

<Info>
  Disconnecting from GitHub will not delete existing deployments. It only stops
  new deployments from being triggered by Git pushes.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- Use a clear branching strategy (e.g., `main` for production, `dev` for testing)
- Protect your production branch if collaborating in teams
- Consider pairing this with the CLI for local preview builds
- Only connect necessary repositories for clarity and security; follow the principle of least privilege
