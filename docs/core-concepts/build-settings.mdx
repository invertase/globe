title: Build Settings
description: Configure how your Dart and Flutter apps are built and deployed, including framework presets, SDK versions, build commands, and entry points.
---

Build settings control how your app is built and deployed in each environment. You can define them in the Globe dashboard or in a version-controlled globe.yaml file to keep environments consistent.

## Why Configure Build Settings?

Configuring build settings allows you to:

- Ensure consistent builds across all environments
- Tailor commands and presets to your framework (e.g., `Flutter`, `Dart Frog`)
- Lock SDK versions to prevent breaking changes
- Set correct entry points and directories for accurate builds
- Standardize configurations across your team with version control

## How to Set Build Settings

You can change your build settings in the dashboard:

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open **Settings** → **General** → **Build Settings**
3. Edit the build settings you want to change (see available settings below)
4. Select **Save Changes** to apply

## Available Build Settings

| **Setting**              | **Description**                                                     | **Default**           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Framework Preset**     | Preset values for the supported frameworks                          | Auto-detected         |
| **Framework Version**    | The version of the framework preset to use (e.g., Dart Frog, Jaspr) | Latest stable version |
| **Build Command**        | Command runs after dependencies are installed                       | Based on framework    |
| **Entrypoint**           | File used to bootstrap your app, e.g. `lib/main.dart`               | Based on framework    |
| **Dart/Flutter Version** | The version of the Dart or Flutter SDK to use for the builds        | Latest stable release |
| **Build Runner**         | Whether to run Build Runner before your project builds              | Auto-detected         |
| **Melos**                | Whether to bootstrap your project at the root                       | Auto-detected         |
| **Root Directory**       | Directory where the project code to deploy is located               | Root directory        |

## Best Practices

- Always set the correct rootDirectory for nested apps
- Tailor your **buildCommand** for production (e.g., `--release`, `tree-shaking`, etc.)
- Use the default framework presets where possible override only when needed
