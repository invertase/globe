title: Build Settings
---

Build settings control how your app is built and deployed in each environment. You can define them in the Globe dashboard or in a version-controlled globe.yaml file to keep environments consistent.

## Why Configure Build Settings?

Configuring build settings allows you to:

- Ensure consistent builds across all environments
- Tailor commands and presets to your framework (e.g., Flutter, Dart Frog)
- Lock SDK versions to prevent breaking changes
- Set correct entry points and directories for accurate builds
- Standardize configurations across your team with version control

## How to Set Build Settings

You can change your build settings in the dashboard:

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open **Settings** → **General** → **Build Settings**
3. Edit values
4. Select **Save Changes** to apply

## Available Build Settings

| **Setting**              | **Description**                                              | **Default**           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Framework Preset**     | Preset values for the supported frameworks                   | Auto-detected         |
| **Build Command**        | Command runs after dependencies are installed                | Based on framework    |
| **Entrypoint**           | File used to bootstrap your app, e.g. `lib/main.dart`        | Based on framework    |
| **Dart/Flutter Version** | The version of the Dart or Flutter SDK to use for the builds | Latest stable release |
| **Build Runner**         | Whether to run Build Runner before your project builds       | Auto-detected         |
| **Melos**                | Whether to bootstrap your project at the root                | Auto-detected         |
| **Root Directory**       | Directory where the project code to deploy is located        | Root directory        |

## Best Practices

- Always set the correct rootDirectory for nested apps
- Tailor your **buildCommand** for production (e.g., `--release`, `tree-shaking`, etc.)
- Use the default framework presets where possible override only when needed

## Next

Manage **sensitive data** and **environment-specific values** using Environment Variables.
