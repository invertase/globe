Track **resource consumption** across your deployments. See **real-time metrics** like **requests** and **resource usage** without setting up external tools.

## Usage Types

Globeâ€™s usage tracking is categorized into two main types:

### 1. Organization-Wide Usage

This provides a high-level view across all your projects, helping you track global resource consumption and trends at a glance.

- **Total Requests:** The cumulative number of requests made across your projects
- **Total Bandwidth:** The total bandwidth consumed
- **Request Breakdown:** A detailed view showing each request type and the number of times it was made
- **Filters:** Easily filter by request type, time range, or project to narrow down your insights

### 2. Project-Level Usage

Select specific projects to track key resource metrics:

- **CPU Usage:** See how much compute power your project is using over time
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory consumption to detect spikes or inefficiencies
- **Network Usage:** Track inbound and outbound network traffic for the project

Each of these metrics is visualized in real-time, helping you understand how your project behaves under different loads and usage patterns.

## Understanding Your Usage Data

At both levels, Globe provides clear, up-to-date visualizations that help you:

- Identify **spikes in consumption** or **unusual activity**
- Optimize for **resource allocation** and **cost**
- Troubleshoot issues related to resource limits
- Monitor usage trends over time

These insights make it easier to manage your resources effectively and ensure stability.
