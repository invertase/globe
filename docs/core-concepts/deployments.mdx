title: Deployments
---

When you run `globe deploy` or push to GitHub, Globe creates a deployment — a versioned build of your app that runs on its global edge network. Use deployments to preview changes, push live updates, and track your app across environments.

## Preview vs Production Deployments

Globe supports two types of deployments: **preview** and **production**.

### Preview Deployments

**Preview deployments** are useful to test, review, and share work-in-progress without affecting the live app. These are ideal for internal review, staging, or QA. They:

- Do not impact the live app
- Use temporary URLs (e.g. random-id.globeapp.dev)
- Auto-expire after a period of inactivity

**Create a preview deployment by:**

- Running `globe deploy` in your terminal
- Pushing to any branch that is **not** set as your production branch in project settings

### Production Deployments

**Production deployments** serve the live version of your app. Trigger one when you're ready to release updates to users. They:

- Replace the current live version of your app
- Persist until manually replaced
- Use your custom domain (if connected), or a default URL like project-name.globeapp.dev

**Trigger a production deployment by:**

- Running `globe deploy --prod` in your terminal
- Pushing to the branch marked as your **production branch** (default: main)

## How to Manage Deployments

You can view and manage deployments in the Globe dashboard:

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open the **Deployments** tab
3. Toggle between **Preview** and **Production** to see all versions
4. Select any deployment to view logs and details
5. Open your deployment via the direct URL

## How Deployments Work

Every deployment goes through five stages:

1. **Source Acquisition:** Code is fetched from your local machine or GitHub repository
2. **Build Process:** Code is compiled and built according to your project's configuration
3. **Containerization:** The build output is packaged into a container
4. **Distribution**: The container is distributed to Globe's global edge network
5. **Activation:** The deployment becomes accessible via a unique URL

## Deployment Status Reference

| Status          | Meaning                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queued**      | Deployment is waiting to be processed               |
| **In Progress** | Globe is building your application                  |
| **Deployed**    | Successfully deployed and available through its URL |
| **Failed**      | Build or deploy process failed                      |
| **Cancelled**   | Deployments were manually stopped before completion |

## Best Practices

- Use preview deployments to test every major change
- Protect production branches in GitHub to avoid accidental deploys
- Use different environment variables for preview and production
- Check logs on failed deployments for quick debugging

Monitor build outputs, runtime errors, and real-time activity from your live app—all in one place with Logs.
