title: Domains
---

A **domain** is the address used to access your Globe-hosted project. Each project is assigned a unique domain (e.g., `your-project.globeapp.dev`).

You can also link your own **custom domain** (e.g., `your-app.com`) with built-in HTTPS, DNS verification, and integration with your production deployment.

### Supported Domain Types

| Domain Type                   | Description                                     | Example                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Default Project Domain**    | Automatically assigned after deployment         | `your-project.globeapp.dev`  |
| **Preview Deployment Domain** | Unique URLs for each preview deployment         | `random-string.globeapp.dev` |
| **Custom Domains**            | Your own branded domains linked to your project | `your-app.com`               |

## How to Add a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS with Your Registrar

Before adding your domain to Globe:

1. Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains)
2. Find the DNS management section
3. Add a **CNAME record** pointing your domain to `domains.globeapp.dev`
4. Save your changes

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, though most updates
  happen within an hour.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain in Globe

1. From your **Globe dashboard**, go to the **Domains** section
2. Select **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `www.your-app.com`)
4. Select the project you want to link to this domain
5. Click **Next** and then **Create**

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain

After adding your domain, Globe will attempt to verify it. The domain status may change as the setup progresses:

- **Active:** Domain is linked, and SSL is enabled
- **Pending Verification:** DNS changes are still updating (can take up to 24 hours)
- **Verification Failed:** DNS records are missing or incorrect

## How to Manage Domains

To view and manage your domains:

- Open the **Domains** tab in your project dashboard
- Check the list of connected domains and their current status
- To remove a domain, select **Delete** from the options menu
- You can add, update, or reassign domains at any time

### Best Practices

- Use a subdomain (`www.` or `app.`) if your root domain hosts other services
- Configure DNS before adding your domain to Globe
- Use descriptive domain names for better clarity and branding
- Limit frequent DNS changes to avoid propagation delays
