description: Configure custom domains for your Globe deployments with automatic HTTPS, DNS verification, and integration with production deployments.

A **domain** is the address used to access your Globe-hosted project. Each project is assigned a unique domain (e.g., `your-project.globeapp.dev`).

You can also link your own **custom domain** (e.g., `your-app.com`) with built-in **HTTPS**, **DNS verification**, and integration with your production deployment.

### Supported Domain Types

| Domain Type                   | Description                                     | Example                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Default Project Domain**    | Automatically assigned after deployment         | `your-project.globeapp.dev`  |
| **Preview Deployment Domain** | Unique URLs for each preview deployment         | `random-string.globeapp.dev` |
| **Custom Domains**            | Your own branded domains linked to your project | `your-app.com`               |

## How to Add a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS with Your Registrar

First, you must configure the DNS records with your domain registrar. The method depends on whether you are using a subdomain or a root domain.

#### Connecting a Subdomain (e.g., `www.your-app.com`)

This is the simplest and most universally supported method.

1. Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., [Cloudflare](https://domains.cloudflare.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), etc.).
2. Find the DNS management section for your domain.
3. Add a `CNAME` record with the following values:
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name / Host**: `www` (or `app`, `api`, etc.)
   - **Value / Points to**: `domains.globeapp.dev`
4. Save your changes.

#### Connecting a Root Domain (e.g., `your-app.com`)

Connecting a root domain requires your DNS provider to support [CNAME Flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/). Standard DNS rules do not allow `CNAME` records at the root level, so this feature is necessary.

You must verify with your provider if they support this. If they do, create a `CNAME` record using `@` for the `Name / Host` field.

- **Type**: `CNAME`
- **Name / Host**: `@`
- **Value / Points to**: `domains.globeapp.dev`

**Workaround for Unsupported Providers**: If your registrar does not support CNAME flattening, you cannot point your root domain directly to Globe. You must either:

- Use a subdomain instead (e.g., `www.your-app.com`).
- Change your domain's nameservers to a provider that does, like [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/), without transferring the domain itself.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain in Globe

Once your DNS records are configured:

1. From your **Globe dashboard**, go to the **Domains** section
2. Select **Add Domain**
3. Enter your full domain name (e.g., `www.your-app.com` or `your-app.com`).
4. Select the project you want to link to this domain
5. Click **Next** and then **Create**

  DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, though most updates
  happen within an hour.

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain

After adding your domain, Globe will attempt to verify it. The domain status may change as the setup progresses:

- **Active:** Domain is linked, and **SSL** is enabled
- **Pending Verification:** DNS changes are still updating.
- **Verification Failed:** DNS records are missing or incorrect

## How to Manage Domains

To view and manage your domains:

- Open the **Domains** tab in your project dashboard
- Check the list of connected domains and their current status
- You can add, update, or reassign domains at any time

## Best Practices

- Use a subdomain (`www`. or `app`.) for the simplest and most reliable configuration.
- If using a root domain, confirm your registrar supports CNAME flattening before adding it to Globe.
- Use descriptive domain names for better clarity and branding
- Limit frequent DNS changes to avoid propagation delays
