title: Monitoring
---

Track **usage** and **performance** across deployments. See **real-time metrics** like **requests** and **resource usage** without setting up external tools.

## Usage Types

Globe’s monitoring is categorized into two main types:

### 1. Organization-Wide Usage

This provides a high-level view across all your projects, helping you track global resource consumption and trends at a glance.

- **Total Requests:** The cumulative number of requests made across your projects
- **Total Bandwidth:** The total bandwidth consumed
- **Request Breakdown:** A detailed view showing each request type and the number of times it was made
- **Filters:** Easily filter by request type, time range, or project to narrow down your insights

### 2. Project-Level Usage

Select specific projects to track essential performance metrics:

- **CPU Usage:** See how much compute power your project is using over time
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory consumption to detect spikes or inefficiencies
- **Network Usage:** Track inbound and outbound network traffic for the project

Each of these metrics is visualized in real-time, helping you understand how your project behaves under different loads and usage patterns.

## Performance Metrics at a Glance

At both levels, Globe provides clear, up-to-date visualizations that help you:

- Identify **traffic surges** or **unusual activity**
- Optimize for **performance** and **cost**
- Troubleshoot issues faster
- Monitor trends over time

These insights make it easier to maintain stability and deliver great experiences to your users.
