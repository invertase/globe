title: Cron Jobs
description: Schedule recurring HTTP-based background tasks in your Globe deployments using cron jobs defined in globe.yaml, running automatically on production.
---

Use cron jobs to run scheduled HTTP requests to your application endpoints at regular intervals. Define them in your `globe.yaml` file and they'll execute automatically on your production deployment without requiring a separate job runner.

## How Cron Jobs Work

Cron jobs in Globe:

- Execute HTTP requests to specific endpoints in your application
- Only run on **production deployments** (not preview or development)
- Are synchronized with each successful production deployment
- Run in **UTC** timezone only

## How to Manage Cron Jobs

Once defined, cron jobs are visible in your Globe dashboard after a production deployment. If a job no longer appears in your `globe.yaml`, it becomes inactive and stops running until re-added.

To view and manage your cron jobs:

1. From your Globe dashboard, navigate to your project
2. Navigate to **Cron Jobs**
3. View your defined cron jobs by **Active** and **Inactive** status

## How to Define a Cron Job

Define cron jobs in your `globe.yaml` file. Here's a simple example:

```yaml
crons:
  - id: refresh_auth_token
    schedule: "*/45 * * * *"
    path: "/auth/refresh" # This is the application endpoint that Globe will call
```

This example schedules a POST request to your application's `/auth/refresh` endpoint every 45 minutes. The `path` value is the **HTTP route** in your application that Globe will call. For more details on cron syntax, see the [unix-cron documentation](https://crontab.guru/).

<Info>
  Globe ensures that cron-triggered requests are **private by default**, meaning
  only internal events can trigger them.
</Info>

## How to Handle Cron Job Requests

Each cron job triggers **a HTTP POST request** to the specified path. You need to write a route handler in your application to process these requests.

Here's an example using `shelf_router`:

```dart
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';

final app = Router();

app.post('/auth/refresh', (Request request) async {
  // Your handler for the endpoint defined in globe.yaml
  // Logic to refresh the auth token
  return Response.ok('ok');
});
```

If your handler returns a status code outside the `2xx` range, it will be displayed as an error on the Globe dashboard.

## Cron Job IDs

The `id` field represents the unique identifier of the cron job. It is used to manage job states and view logs in the dashboard.

- The list **cannot** contain duplicate IDs
- Maximum length: 50 characters
- Allowed characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`

If a job is removed and later re-added with the same ID, its log history will persist.

## Best Practices

- Name cron jobs clearly (e.g., `refresh_auth_token`, `db_cleanup`)
- Use tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to help design cron expressions
- Monitor jobs via the dashboard to catch issues early
- Consider logging actions/failures in cron handlers for easier observability
