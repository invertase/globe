title: Cron Jobs
---

Schedule **recurring background tasks** by defining HTTP-based cron jobs. Tasks run automatically **after production deployments**; no separate job runner needed.

Globe supports defining cron jobs directly in your `globe.yaml` file. These scheduled tasks run periodically against specified HTTP paths in your production deployment, helping you maintain consistency, reduce manual overhead, and scale reliably.

### Cron jobs in Globe.dev:

- Execute HTTP requests to specific endpoints in your application
- Only run on **production deployments** (not preview or development)
- Are synchronized with each successful production deployment
- Run in **UTC** timezone only

### How to Manage Cron Jobs

Once defined, cron jobs are visible in your Globe dashboard after a production deployment. If a job no longer appears in your `globe.yaml`, it becomes inactive and stops running until re-added.

1. From your Globe dashboard, navigate to your project
2. Navigate to **Cron Jobs**
3. View your defined Cron Jobs by **Active** and **Inactive** jobs

### How to Define a Cron Job

Here’s how you can define a simple cron job in `globe.yaml`:

```yaml
crons:
  - id: refresh_auth_token
    schedule: "*/45 * * * *"
    path: "/auth/refresh"
```

This example schedules a request to `/auth/refresh` every 45 minutes. For more details on cron syntax, see the [unix-cron documentation](https://crontab.guru/).

Globe ensures that these cron-triggered requests are **private by default**, meaning only internal events can trigger them. To make an endpoint public (not recommended for sensitive paths), disable the privacy setting:

```yaml
crons:
  - id: refresh_auth_token
    schedule: "*/45 * * * *"
    path: "/auth/refresh"
    private: false # This endpoint is now publicly accessible
```

### How to Handle Cron Job Requests

Each cron job triggers **an HTTP POST request** to the specified path. You need to write a route to handle this in your application.

Here’s an example using `shelf_router`:

```dart
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';

final app = Router();

app.post('/auth/refresh', (Request request) async {
  // Logic to refresh the auth token
  return Response.ok('ok');
});
```

If your handler returns a status code outside the `2xx` range, it will be displayed as an error on the Globe dashboard.

### Cron Job IDs

The `id` field represents the unique identifier of the cron job. It is used to manage job states and view logs in the dashboard.

- The list **cannot** contain duplicate IDs
- Max length: 50 characters
- Allowed characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`

If a job is removed and later re-added with the same ID, its log history will persist.

### Best Practices

- Keep sensitive endpoints **private** (default behavior)
- Name cron jobs clearly (e.g., `refresh_auth_token`, `db_cleanup`)
- Use tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to help design cron expressions
- Monitor jobs via the dashboard to catch issues early
- Consider logging actions/failures in cron handlers for easier observability
