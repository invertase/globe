title: Logs

Logs show what's happening during your build and runtime. Use them to debug errors, monitor behaviour, and validate configuration across environments.

## Why Logs Matter

Logs help you:

- Debug build and runtime issues quickly
- Monitor application behavior in real-time
- Validate deployments and configuration changes
- Track backend activity and user interactions

## Viewing Logs in the Dashboard

To view logs for any deployment:

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open the **Logs** tab
3. Filter by **severity** or **time** range
4. Use the search bar to find specific messages
5. Click into any deployment for more details

Each log entry shows:

- **Timestamps**: Every log entry is tagged with an accurate timestamp to trace events precisely
- **Filtering**: Filter logs by severity levels like INFO and ERROR for quicker debugging
- **Search**: Instantly search through logs to find relevant messages
- **Time Range Selection**: Focus on specific timeframes to narrow down issues

## Types of Logs

Logs are grouped by severity to simplify triage:

| **Level** | **Description**                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Info**  | Routine activity messages, i.e., requests received or background jobs completed.               |
| **Error** | Issues that disrupt functionality, i.e. failed builds, server errors, or unhandled exceptions. |

Use logging levels in your app code to control what gets recorded and what's relevant in production vs local debugging.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of your logs:

- Use structured logging in your code for better filtering and parsing
- Include context, like user IDs, request IDs, or environment tags to your messages
- Apply appropriate log levels to reduce noise
- Never log sensitive data such as passwords or personal information
- Write clear, descriptive messages that explain what happened and why

## Next

Control how your app is built by configuring settings like SDK version, build command, and entry point.
