description: Monitor runtime logs for your Globe deployments to debug errors, track application behavior, and validate configuration changes.
---

Logs show what's happening in your running application. Use them to **debug errors**, **monitor behaviour**, and **validate configuration** across environments.

## Why Logs Matter

Logs help you:

- Debug runtime issues quickly
- Monitor application behavior in real-time
- Track backend activity and user interactions
- Validate configuration changes

## Viewing Logs in the Dashboard

To view logs for any deployment:

1. In the **Globe dashboard**, go to your project
2. Open the **Logs** tab
3. Filter by **severity** or **time** range
4. Use the search bar to find specific messages
5. Click into any deployment for more details

Each log entry shows:

- **Timestamps**: Every log entry is tagged with an accurate timestamp to trace events precisely
- **Filtering**: Filter logs by severity levels like **INFO** and **ERROR** for quicker debugging
- **Search**: Instantly search through logs to find relevant messages
- **Time Range Selection**: Focus on specific timeframes to narrow down issues

## Log Severity Levels

Logs are grouped by **severity** to simplify triage:

| **Level** | **Description**                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Info**  | Routine activity messages, i.e., requests received or background jobs completed. |
| **Error** | Issues that disrupt functionality, i.e. server errors or unhandled exceptions.   |

Use logging levels in your app code to control what gets recorded and what's relevant in production vs local debugging.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of your logs:

- Use **structured logging** in your code for better filtering and parsing
- Include context, like user IDs, request IDs, or environment tags to your messages
- Apply appropriate log levels to reduce noise
- Never log sensitive data such as passwords or personal information
- Write clear, descriptive messages that explain what happened and why
