description: Deploy your Dart and Flutter applications to Globe directly from the command line using the globe deploy command, with support for preview and production deployments.
---

The `globe deploy` command allows you to deploy your Dart application to Globe directly from the command line.

## Usage

```bash
globe deploy [flags]
```

## Flags

- `--prod`: Creates a production deployment. Without this flag, a preview deployment is created
- `--logs`: Streams the build logs to your terminal
- `--project`: Specify a project ID or name (useful for monorepos or when you have multiple linked projects)
- `--help`: Display help information
- `--verbose`: Display verbose output
- `--token`: Use API token for CLI authentication

## Workflow

1. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open your terminal and go into the root directory of your Dart project (the directory containing your `pubspec.yaml` file)

2. **Link your project (if not already linked)**: If this is the first time you're deploying this project, run `globe link`. This will guide you through the process of linking your local directory to a Globe project (either an existing project or a new one)

3. **Run globe deploy:**
   - For a preview deployment (recommended for testing):
     ```bash
     globe deploy
     ```
   - For a production deployment (to your live application):
     ```bash
     globe deploy --prod
     ```

4. **Follow the prompts**: The CLI may prompt you for confirmation or to select a project (if you have multiple linked projects and haven't used the `--project` flag)

5. **Wait for deployment**: The CLI will package your code, upload it to Globe, build your application, and deploy it. You'll see progress updates in the terminal

6. **Access your deployment**: Once the deployment is complete, the CLI will display a URL where you can access your application

## Examples

**Preview Deployment:**

```bash
cd my_dart_project
globe deploy
```

**Production Deployment:**

```bash
cd my_dart_project
globe deploy --prod
```

**Deploying a specific project in a multi-project directory:**

```bash
cd my_monorepo
globe deploy --project="my-backend-project"
```
