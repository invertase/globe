description: Install and use the Globe CLI to deploy Dart and Flutter apps, manage projects, view build logs, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines from your terminal.
---

The Globe CLI is a command-line tool that lets you deploy and manage your Globe projects directly from your terminal. Use it to deploy applications, view build logs, manage authentication tokens, create projects from templates, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines—all without leaving your command line.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must have the Dart SDK installed on your machine.

## Installation

To install the Globe CLI on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate globe_cli
```

After installation, confirm it's available by running:

```bash
globe --help
```

## Inspecting Version

To check your current version of the Globe CLI:

```bash
globe --version
```

If there's a newer version available, you’ll see a notification when running any CLI command.

## Why Use the Globe CLI?

- **Deploy quickly:** Deploy Flutter and Dart apps in seconds from your terminal
- **Terminal-first workflow:** Manage deployments without leaving your terminal
- **Multi-project support:** Link and manage multiple apps or mono-repos
- **Secure authentication:** Securely manage project-specific tokens
- **Real-time monitoring:** View build logs directly from your terminal
- **CI/CD integration:** Easily integrate into shell scripts or CI/CD pipelines

## CLI Commands

The Globe CLI provides the following commands, which can be accessed by running globe `command` `subcommand`:

- [`deploy`](/core-concepts/cli/deploying-a-project): Deploys your Dart application to Globe.
- [`login`](/core-concepts/cli/login-and-logout): Logs you into your Globe account.
- [`logout`](/core-concepts/cli/login-and-logout): Logs you out of your Globe account.
- [`link`](/core-concepts/cli/link-and-unlink): Links a local project directory to a Globe project.
- [`unlink`](/core-concepts/cli/link-and-unlink): Unlinks a local project directory from a Globe project.
- [`token create`](/core-concepts/cli/managing-tokens): Creates a new authentication token.
- [`token list`](/core-concepts/cli/managing-tokens): Lists your existing authentication tokens.
- [`token delete`](/core-concepts/cli/managing-tokens): Deletes an authentication token.

You can get help for any command by adding the --help flag (e.g., globe deploy --help).

## Global Flags

All CLI commands have global flags that can be used to modify the behavior of the command, which can be accessed by running globe `command` `--flag`.
