title: Globe CLI Overview
description: Install and start deploying using the Globe CLI.
---

Use the Globe CLI to deploy and manage projects from your **terminal**. Ideal for automation, scripting, or working locally without switching to the dashboard.

The CLI also provides a consistent and flexible way to manage your projects, view build logs, create templates, and more.

## Pre-Requisites

To get started, you must have the Dart SDK installed on your machine.

## Installation

To install the Globe CLI on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate globe_cli
```

After installation, confirm it's available by running:

```bash
globe --help
```

## Inspecting Version

To check your current version of the Globe CLI:

```bash
globe --version
```

If there's a newer version available, youâ€™ll see a notification when running any CLI command.

## Why Use the Globe CLI?

- Deploy Flutter and Dart apps in seconds.
- Manage deployments without leaving your terminal.
- Link and manage multiple apps or mono-repos.
- Securely manage project-specific tokens.
- View build logs directly from your terminal.
- Easily integrate into shell scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

## CLI Commands

The Globe CLI provides the following commands, which can be accessed by running globe `command` `subcommand`:

- [`deploy`](/core-concepts/cli/deploying-a-project): Deploys your Dart application to Globe.
- [`login`](/core-concepts/cli/login-and-logout): Logs you into your Globe account.
- [`logout`](/core-concepts/cli/login-and-logout): Logs you out of your Globe account.

You can get help for any command by adding the --help flag (e.g., globe deploy --help).
