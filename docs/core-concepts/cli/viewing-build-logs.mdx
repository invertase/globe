title: Viewing Build Logs
---

You can view the build logs for your deployments in two ways:

## 1. During Deployment (with `--logs`)

    Use the `--logs` flag with `globe deploy` to stream the build logs directly to your terminal:

    ```bash
    # Stream logs during the deployment process
    globe deploy --logs
    ```

## 2. After Deployment (with `globe build-logs`)

    Use the `globe build-logs` command to view the logs for a specific deployment. You'll need the deployment ID for this.

    ```bash
    # Fetch logs for a specific deployment using its ID
    globe build-logs -d <DEPLOYMENT_ID>
    ```

<Info>
  You can find the deployment ID in the Globe dashboard (usually within the
  deployment details page) or often in the output provided right after running
  the `globe deploy` command.
</Info>

## Usage

```bash
globe build-logs [flags]
```

## Flags

- `-d`, `--deployment`: **Required.** The ID of the deployment.
- `--help`: Displays help information.
- `--verbose`: Displays verbose output.
- `--token`: Use API token for CLI Auth.
- `--project`: Set the Project ID used by this command. Defaults to what was previously linked using `globe link`.
