title: The globe.yaml File
description: Define your project configuration in a version-controlled globe.yaml file to manage build settings, assets, cron jobs, and deployment settings as code.
---

Define your project’s configuration in a version-controlled `globe.yaml` file. This allows you to keep settings consistent across environments, automate deployments, and manage configurations as code.

## Why use the `globe.yaml` File?

While you can configure your project in the Globe dashboard, using a `globe.yaml` file provides several advantages:

- **Version Control**: Track changes to your configuration alongside your code.
- **Consistency**: Ensure every team member and deployment uses the same settings.
- **Automation**: Standardize your CI/CD pipeline with a reliable configuration source.
- **Clarity**: Define complex settings like build presets, assets, and cron jobs in one clear location.

## How to Set Up the `globe.yaml` File

Create a `globe.yaml` file in the root of your project directory. For the best editing experience with autocompletion and validation, we recommend using the [YAML extension by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) in VS Code.

Add the following comment to the top of your file to enable schema validation:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://globe.dev/globe.schema.json

# Your configuration starts here
```

## Configuration Options

Below are the available top-level properties you can define in your `globe.yaml`.

### `entrypoint`

The main entry point of your Dart application. This is the file Globe runs to start your server.

```yaml
entrypoint: bin/server.dart
```

### `build`

A nested object containing settings related to the **build** process, such as framework **presets**, **Melos** integration, and **Build Runner** commands.

### `preset`

Configure a framework-specific preset to streamline your build. Supported types include `dart_frog`, `flutter`, `flutter_server`, `jaspr`, `jaspr_static`, and `serverpod`. You can also specify a `version` and override the default `buildCommand`.

```yaml
build:
  preset:
    type: dart_frog
    version: '1.1.0'
    buildCommand: dart_frog build
```

### `melos` and `build_runner`

Enable or disable automatic detection for Melos and Build Runner, or provide custom commands if needed. By default, Globe auto-detects if these tools are needed.

```yaml
build:
  melos:
    automatic_detection: true # Defaults to true
    # command: melos bootstrap
  build_runner:
    automatic_detection: false # Disable if not needed
    # command: dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### `assets`

A list of static files or directories to include in your deployment. Globe serves these assets from its global edge network. You can include individual files, entire directories (by adding a trailing slash `/`), or use glob patterns. You can also map a source file to a different destination path.

For more details, see the [Static Assets](/core-concepts/static-assets) documentation.

```yaml
assets:
  # Include a specific file
  - assets/logo.png
  # Include an entire directory
  - public/
  # Include all .css files in a directory
  - styles/*.css
  # Map a source file to a new destination path
  - compiled_output/lib.so:public/native_lib.so
```

### `crons`

Define scheduled tasks that trigger HTTP POST requests to your application at specified intervals. Cron jobs only run on **production deployments**. Each cron job requires a unique `id`, a `schedule` (in unix-cron format), and a `path` to an endpoint in your app.

For more details, see the [Cron Jobs](/core-concepts/cron-jobs) documentation.

```yaml
crons:
  - id: daily_database_cleanup
    schedule: '0 0 * * *' # Runs every day at midnight UTC
    path: '/tasks/db-cleanup'
  - id: refresh_cache
    schedule: '*/30 * * * *' # Runs every 30 minutes
    path: '/tasks/refresh-cache'
```

### `preferred_regions`

A list of preferred regions for your deployment. This helps Globe optimize performance by serving your application from edge locations closest to your users.

```yaml
preferred_regions:
  - us-east1
  - europe-west1
```

## Complete Example

Here is an example of a globe.yaml file that combines several of the options above, following the recommended order.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://globe.dev/globe.schema.json

entrypoint: bin/server.dart

build:
  preset:
    type: dart_frog
    # buildCommand: dart_frog build
    # version: "1.1.0"
  build_runner:
    automatic_detection: false
    # command: dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  melos:
    automatic_detection: false
    # command: melos bootstrap
    # version: "6.3.3"

assets:
  - public/
  - assets/images/
  - compiled/library.wasm:public/library.wasm

crons:
  - id: send_weekly_newsletter
    schedule: '0 8 * * 1' # Every Monday at 8:00 AM UTC
    path: '/api/v1/newsletter/send'

preferred_regions:
  - us-west1
  - europe-central2
```

## Best Practices

- Commit `globe.yaml` to your Git repository to keep it in sync with your codebase.
- Use the **schema definition** in your editor for autocompletion and to prevent typos.
- **Document** complex configurations or non-obvious settings with comments.
- Start with a minimal configuration and only add properties as you need to override defaults.
