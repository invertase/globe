title: Static Assets
description: Serve static files like images, fonts, and HTML from your Globe deployment using automatic detection or manual configuration in globe.yaml.
---

When deploying to Globe, static assets configured in your code are excluded from the deployment. Use Globe's static assets configuration to specify which files and directories should be served, ensuring your images, fonts, and other static resources are available to your application.

## What Are Static Assets?

Static assets are files that don’t change at runtime. Think `.png`, `.css`, `.html`, fonts, or even compiled `.wasm` files. Globe serves these assets via a **global edge network** to ensure speedy delivery anywhere in the world.

## How Static Assets Work in Globe

You can configure static assets in two ways:

### 1. Automatic Detection (Zero Config)

Globe automatically detects common static asset directories used by most frameworks, such as `public/`, `static/`, and `assets/`. For Serverpod projects, it also includes `web/`, `config/`, and `migrations/`. All files and subdirectories within these folders are served as static assets by default.

### 2. Manual Configuration (`globe.yaml`)

For more control, explicitly list files and directories in your `globe.yaml` file under the `assets` key.

#### Include Specific Files

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_icon.png
  - assets/background.png
```

#### Include Specific Directories

To include all files under a folder, simply add the directory with a trailing slash:

```yaml
assets:
  - directory/
  - directory/subdirectory/
```

#### Use Glob Patterns

You can match multiple files using **glob-like syntax**. This helps include file types in bulk, like all `.png` images in a directory:

```yaml
assets:
  - public/\*.png
```

This will include every `.png` file in the public/ directory.

#### Map Files to Custom Paths

Want more control over where your assets end up at runtime? You can map a local source path to a destination path in Globe's runtime using `source_path:destination_path`:

```yaml
assets:
  - fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```

This is useful when renaming files, serving compiled libraries, or tidying up your directory structure before deployment.

## Example: Serving Static Files in Dart

Globe supports static file serving with popular Dart web frameworks like **Shelf** and **Dart Frog**. Here’s an example using `shelf_static` to serve a basic `index.html` file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Directory Structure">
  ```yaml
  /your_project
    └── public/
        └── index.html
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dart Server Code">
  ```dart
  import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;
  import 'package:shelf_static/shelf_static.dart';

  void main() async {
    final handler = createStaticHandler('public', defaultDocument: 'index.html');
    final server = await io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080);
    print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
  }
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy with Globe">
  ```bash
  globe deploy
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

And your static site is live from the edge.

## Prerequisites

Before static assets can be served, they must meet these requirements:

- **Assets must be explicitly configured or detected:** Static assets only work if they are correctly configured. Globe won't serve them unless they're automatically detected in common directories (like `public/`, `static/`, `assets/`) or explicitly listed in your `globe.yaml` file under the `assets` key
- **Manual rules override detection:** If both automatic detection and manual configuration are used, `globe.yaml` settings override automatic detection
- **Rule order matters:** The order of items in `globe.yaml` matters; later rules can override earlier ones

## Best Practices

- Keep assets in a dedicated directory like `public/` or `assets/` for better organization
- Use **glob patterns** for file groups, but always confirm matched files
- Avoid deeply nested structures for critical assets
- Be mindful of asset sizes to optimize delivery performance
- Test your static assets after deployment to ensure they're being served correctly
- Keep your asset configuration simple and organized to avoid conflicts
