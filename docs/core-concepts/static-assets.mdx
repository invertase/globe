title: Static Assets
---

Serve static files like images, fonts, or HTML from your deployment. Globe auto-detects common folders, or you can define exactly what to include in your app.

## What Are Static Assets?

Static assets are files that don’t change at runtime—think `.png`, `.css`, `.html`, fonts, or even compiled `.wasm` files. Globe serves these assets via a global edge network to ensure speedy delivery anywhere in the world.

## How Static Assets Work in Globe

You can configure static assets in two ways:

### 1. Automatic Detection (Zero Config)

Globe automatically detects common static asset directories used by most frameworks, such as `public/`, `static/`, and `assets/`. For Serverpod projects, it also includes `web/`, `config/`, and `migrations/`. All files and subdirectories within these folders are served as static assets by default.

### 2. Manual Configuration (`globe.yaml`)

For more control, explicitly list files and directories in your `globe.yaml` file under the `assets` key.

#### Include Specific Files

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_icon.png
  - assets/background.png
```

#### Include Specific Directories

To include all files under a folder, simply add the directory with a trailing slash:

```yaml
assets:
  - directory/
  - directory/subdirectory/
```

#### Use Glob Patterns

You can match multiple files using glob-like syntax. This helps include file types in bulk, like all .png images in a directory:

```yaml
assets:
  - public/\*.png
```

This will include every .png file in the public/ directory.

#### Map Files to Custom Paths

Want more control over where your assets end up at runtime? You can map a local source path to a destination path in Globe’s runtime using source_path:destination_path:

```yaml
assets:
  - fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```

This is useful when renaming files, serving compiled libraries, or tidying up your directory structure before deployment.

## Example: Serving Static Files in Dart

Globe supports static file serving with popular Dart web frameworks like **Shelf** and **Dart Frog**. Here’s an example using `shelf_static` to serve a basic `index.html` file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Directory Structure">
  ```yaml
  /your_project
    └── public/
        └── index.html
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dart Server Code">
  ```dart
  import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;
  import 'package:shelf_static/shelf_static.dart';

  void main() async {
    final handler = createStaticHandler('public', defaultDocument: 'index.html');
    final server = await io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080);
    print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
  }
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy with Globe">
  ```bash
  globe deploy
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

And your static site is live from the edge.

## Notes

- Static assets only work if **they are correctly configured**. Globe won’t magically serve them unless they’re detected or explicitly listed.
- If both **automatic** and **manual** configurations are used, globe.yaml settings override **automatic detection**.
- The order of items in globe.yaml matters—later rules can override earlier ones.

## Best Practices

- Keep assets in a dedicated directory like `public/` or `assets/`
- Use **glob patterns** for file groups, but always confirm matched files
- Avoid deeply nested structures for critical assets
- Be mindful of asset size and redundancy
- Stay organized, name assets clearly for easier maintenance
