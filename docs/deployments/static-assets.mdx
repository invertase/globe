title: Static Assets

#### **Overview**

Globe now offers built-in support for serving static files like images, HTML templates, and branding assets directly from your application. It works seamlessly with middleware's like `shelf_static` Shelf and Dart Frog.

#### **Defining Assets**

You can specify directories or files using the syntax below in `globe.yaml`, similar to Flutter asset definition:

```yaml
assets:
  - public/
  - some-file.png
```

![](/.png)

##### **More examples**

- Use glob-like `*.png` to include matching files.

```yaml
- public/*.png
```

- Use `source_path:destination_path` to map files into Globe Runtime.

```yaml
- fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```
#### **Using Static Assets**

Static asset serving is ideal for:

* Hosting HTML templates for your application  
* Serving static resources such as images or documents.
