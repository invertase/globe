title: Static Assets
---

Globe offers built-in support for serving **Static Files** like images, HTML templates, and branding assets directly from your application. It works seamlessly with middleware's like `shelf_static` Shelf and Dart Frog.

## Specifying assets

You can specify directories or files using the syntax below in `globe.yaml` config file similar to [Flutter Asset Definition](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images) in your project directory.

Here is an example:

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_icon.png
  - assets/background.png
```

To include all assets under a directory, specify the directory name with the / character at the end:

```yaml
assets:
  - directory/
  - directory/subdirectory/
```

<Info>
  Globe will automatically detect common directories for frameworks such as
  `public/`, `static/`, `assets`. eg: For *Serverpod*, `config/`, `migrations/`
  and `web/* directories are automatically bundled.

- **Glob patterns**: You can use glob-like `*.png` to include matching files. For example, this configuration includes all .png files in the public/ directory:

```yaml
- public/*.png
```

- **Mapping source and destination paths**: You can use `source_path:destination_path` to map files into Globe Runtime. This is useful for renaming or organising files when serving them:

```yaml
- fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```

_The image above shows the deployment process of a website built with Dart using Globe CLI. The terminal logs key steps, including queuing, in-progress status, and a final deployment URL._

- **Dart’s shelf_static library**: The code below demonstrates how to use Dart’s shelf_static library to serve static files from a directory. This is useful for setting up a simple HTTP server to host your static assets:

- **Hosting HTML templates**: An HTML file in the public/ directory can be served as the main entry point for your static website. Here’s an example that uses Tailwind CSS for styling:
