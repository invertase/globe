title: Static Assets
---

#### **Overview**

Globe offers built-in support for serving static files like images, HTML templates, and branding assets directly from your application. It works seamlessly with middleware's like `shelf_static` Shelf and Dart Frog.

#### **Defining Assets**

You can specify directories or files using the syntax below in `globe.yaml`, similar to Flutter asset definition:

```yaml
assets:
  - public/
  - some-file.png
```

*The image above shows the deployment process of a website built with Dart using Globe CLI. The terminal logs key steps, including queuing, in-progress status, and a final deployment URL.*


##### **Examples*

- **Glob patterns**: You can use glob-like `*.png` to include matching files. For example, this configuration includes all .png files in the public/ directory:

```yaml
- public/*.png
```

- **Mapping source and destination paths**: You can use `source_path:destination_path` to map files into Globe Runtime. This is useful for renaming or organising files when serving them:

```yaml
- fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```
- **Dart’s shelf_static library**: The code below demonstrates how to use Dart’s shelf_static library to serve static files from a directory. This is useful for setting up a simple HTTP server to host your static assets:

- **Hosting HTML templates**: An HTML file in the public/ directory can be served as the main entry point for your static website. Here’s an example that uses Tailwind CSS for styling:
