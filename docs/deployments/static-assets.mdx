title: Static Assets
---

Globe offers built-in support for serving **Static Files** like images, HTML templates, and branding assets directly from your application. It works seamlessly with middleware's like `shelf_static` Shelf and Dart Frog.

## Specifying assets

You can specify directories or files using the syntax below in `globe.yaml` config file similar to [Flutter Asset Definition](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images) in your project directory.

Here is an example:

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_icon.png
  - assets/background.png
```

To include all assets under a directory, specify the directory name with the / character at the end:

```yaml
assets:
  - directory/
  - directory/subdirectory/
```

<Info>
  Globe will automatically detect common directories for frameworks such as
  `public/`, `static/`, `assets`. eg: For **Serverpod**, `config/`,
  `migrations/` and `web/` are automatically bundled.

### Glob patterns

You can use glob-like `*.png` to include matching files. For example, this configuration includes all .png files in the public/ directory:

```yaml
assets:
  - public/*.png
```

### Mapping source and destination paths

You can use `source_path:destination_path` to map files into Globe Runtime. This is useful for renaming or organising files when serving them:

```yaml
assets:
  - fake_lib_rust/target/fake_library.so:public/fake_library.so
```

## Examples

### Shelf + `shelf_static`

The code below demonstrates how to use Dartâ€™s [shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) and [shelf_static](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_static) middleware to serve a simple `index.html` file:
![Dart Code for Static Server](/assets/dart-serve-static-code.png)

Below is what our `index.html` file looks like:

![HTML Example](/assets/dart-serve-static-html-code.png)

And now we deploy using `globe deploy`

![Deployment Process](/assets/deployment-process-terminal.png)

_The image above shows the deployment process of a website built with Dart using Globe CLI. The terminal logs key steps, including queuing, in-progress status, and a final deployment URL._
