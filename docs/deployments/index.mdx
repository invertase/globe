# Deployments

A deployment can be triggered when you wish to deploy new code to your Globe project. In Globe, a deployment can be staged to two environments; **Production** or **Preview**.
When a Production deployment has successfully built, your domains will be updated automatically to point to the new deployment. Preview deployments on the other are accessible
via a URL unique to the deployment. This allows you to test and share your changes on a live environment before deploying to production.

Once deployments have successfully built, you can access the unique URL from the Globe dashboard.

## Creating a preview deployment

To create a new preview deployment, you have two options:

### via the CLI

Run the [`deploy`](/docs/cli/commands/deploy) command. By default, deployments from the CLI are staged as a preview deployment:

```bash
globe deploy
```

### via GitHub

Using the [GitHub Integration](/docs/deployments/github-integration), you can trigger a preview deployment by pushing to a branch which
is not defined as the production branch in your projects settings.

To learn more, view the [GitHub Integration](/docs/deployments/github-integration) documentation.

## Creating a production deployment

To create a new production deployment, you have two options:

### via the CLI

Run the [`deploy`](/docs/cli/commands/deploy) command with the `--prod` flag:

```bash
globe deploy --prod
```

### via GitHub

Using the [GitHub Integration](/docs/deployments/github-integration), you can trigger a production deployment by pushing to the branch
specified in your projects settings. By default, this is the `main` branch.
