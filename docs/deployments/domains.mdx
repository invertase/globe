A domain is the address used to access your Globe-hosted project. By default, each project is assigned a unique domain (e.g., `your-project.globe.com`). You can also link a custom domain to your project for a branded experience.

## Linking a Custom Domain

Custom domains allow you to connect your branded URL (e.g., `your-company.com`) to your Globe-hosted project. This makes your project accessible on a domain of your choice.

### How It Works

1. Register a domain with an external provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains).
2. Configure your DNS settings to point to Globe.
3. Verify ownership in the Globe Dashboard.
4. Cloudflare handles DNS management and security, including automatic SSL (HTTPS).

Currently, each Globe project can have only one custom domain. To add a new domain, you must remove the existing one first. We will be adding support for multiple domains soon.

## Setting Up Your Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS with Your Registrar

Before adding a custom domain to Globe, update your DNS settings with your domain provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Google Domains, Cloudflare).

- Add a **CNAME record** pointing your domain to the value provided by Globe.
- Follow your provider’s setup instructions.

Once updated, add your domain in the Globe Dashboard and verify it.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain in Globe

Each Globe project can have only one linked custom domain at a time. If you want to add a new domain, you must first remove the existing one. We are working on adding support for multiple domains!

1. Go to the **Globe Dashboard**.
2. Select your project and navigate to **Domains**.
3. Click **Add Custom Domain**.
4. Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
5. Click **Verify**.

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain

After adding your domain, Globe will display one of these statuses:

- **Active** – The domain is linked, and SSL is enabled.
- **Pending Verification** – DNS changes are still updating (this can take up to 24 hours).
- **Verification Failed** – DNS records are incorrect or missing; update your DNS settings and retry.

## Removing or Changing a Domain

Since each project currently supports only one domain, you must remove an existing domain before adding a new one.

To remove a domain:

1. Go to **Globe Dashboard → Domains**.
2. Click on the existing domain.
3. Click **Remove Domain**.

Once removed, follow the setup steps above to add a new domain.

## Troubleshooting

If verification fails, Globe will display an error message. Some common issues include:

- **"DNS Records Not Found"** – Wait up to 24 hours, or check your DNS settings with your provider.
- **"Invalid Domain Format"** – Ensure the domain is entered correctly.
- **"SSL Certificate Not Issued”** – Check for misconfigured CAA records.

If you get an error you can't fix, check your DNS settings, try re-adding the domain in Globe, refer to Cloudflare's [DNS Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/troubleshooting/), or reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UCcCYjDaTy) for help.
