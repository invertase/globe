A domain is the address used to access your Globe-hosted project. By default, each project is assigned a unique domain (e.g., `your-project.globe.com`). You can also link a custom domain to your project for a branded experience.

## Linking a Custom Domain

Custom domains allow you to connect your branded URL (e.g., `your-company.com`) to your Globe-hosted project. This makes your project accessible on a domain of your choice.

### How It Works

1. Register a domain with an external provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains).
2. Configure your DNS settings to point to Globe.
3. Add your domain to a project via the Globe Dashbord.
4. Cloudflare handles DNS management and security, including automatic SSL (HTTPS).

## Setting Up Your Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS with Your Registrar

Before adding a custom domain to Globe, update your DNS settings with your domain provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Google Domains, Cloudflare).

- Add a **CNAME record** pointing your domain to the value provided by Globe.
- Follow your provider’s setup instructions.

Once updated, add your domain in the Globe Dashboard and verify it.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain in Globe

1. Go to the **Globe Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Domains**.
3. Select **Add Domain**.
4. Enter your domain name (e.g., `example-app.com`).
5. Select **Verify**.

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain

After you add your domain, Cloudflare will attempt to verify it. The domain status may change as the setup progresses:

- **Active** – The domain is linked, and SSL is enabled.
- **Pending Verification** - DNS changes are still updating. This can take up to 24 hours.
- **Verification Failed** – DNS records are missing or incorrect. Check your DNS settings and try again.

## Removing or Changing a Domain

To remove a domain:

1. Go to **Domains**.
2. Select the existing domain.
3. Select **Remove Domain**.

Once removed, follow the setup steps above to add a new domain.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into errors when adding or verifying a domain, try the following:

- **Check your DNS settings** with your domain provider. Make sure required records exist and are correct.
- **Remove and re-add the domain** in Globe. This can fix temporary connection errors.
- **Wait up to 24 hours** if your domain was recently updated. DNS changes can take time to propagate.
- **Review [Cloudflare’s Troubleshooting Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/troubleshooting/)** for help with DNS-specific errors.
