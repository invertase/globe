title: Domains

A domain is the address used to access your Globe-hosted project. By default, each project is assigned a unique domain, which you can use to access your deployment.

## Production Domains

Each project gets assigned a unique domain when created (e.g., your-project.globe.com). Whenever you successfully deploy to the production environment, the production domain will be updated to point to the latest deployment.

If the deployment is unsuccessful or still in progress, visiting the domain will redirect you to the deployment’s dashboard.

## Custom Domains

Custom domains allow you to connect your branded URL (e.g., your-company.com) to your Globe-hosted project. This provides a more professional appearance for your project, allowing you to serve it on a domain of your choice.

### How It Works

1. You register a domain with an external provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains).
2. You configure your domain’s DNS settings to point to Globe.
3. You verify ownership in the Globe Dashboard.
4. Cloudflare manages DNS and security in the background, including automatic SSL (HTTPS).

Currently, each Globe project can have only one custom domain. To add a new domain, you must remove the existing one first. We will be adding support for multiple domains soon.

## Setting Up Your Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS with Your Registrar

Before adding a custom domain to Globe, you must configure it with your registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Google Domains, Cloudflare). To do this:

Log in to your domain provider and update your DNS records as follows:

| Record Type | Name                   | Value (Points to) |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| CNAME       | `@` (or `example.com`) | Provided by Globe |
| CNAME       | `www`                  | Provided by Globe |

If your provider does not support CNAME flattening for apex domains (example.com), use an [A record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/) instead.

Once updated, proceed to the Globe Dashboard to verify the domain.

### Step 2: Adding Your Domain in Globe

1. Go to the Globe Dashboard.
2. Select your project and navigate to "Domains".
3. Click "Add Custom Domain".
4. Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
5. Click "Verify".

#### What Happens Next?

- If verification succeeds, the domain is linked, and SSL is issued automatically.
- If verification fails, an error message will appear (see troubleshooting below).

### Step 3: Understanding Domain Status

After adding your domain, Globe will display one of the following statuses:

| Status                  | Meaning                                                                 | Action Required?                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Active**              | The domain is linked, and SSL is enabled.                               | No action needed.                    |
| **Pending**             | The domain setup is incomplete or waiting for DNS changes to propagate. | Wait up to 24 hours and check again. |
| **Verification Failed** | DNS records are incorrect or missing.                                   | Fix DNS settings and retry.          |
| **Expired**             | (Draft: Does this mean the user removed the domain or the SSL expired?) | Check if renewal is needed.          |
| **Error**               | A problem occurred during setup (see error messages below).             | Follow the troubleshooting steps.    |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your domain verification fails, Globe will display an error message. Below are possible errors and how to fix them:

### "DNS Records Not Found"

**Cause**: Your DNS provider has not propagated the CNAME record yet.

**Fix**:

- Wait up to 24 hours for DNS changes to take effect.
- Use Google’s Dig tool to check if your CNAME record is active.
- Ensure the correct values were entered.

### "Domain Already in Use"

**Cause**: The domain is linked to another Globe project.

**Fix**: Remove it from the previous project before adding it to a new one.

### "Invalid Domain Format"

**Cause**: The domain was entered incorrectly (e.g., missing .com).

**Fix**: Double-check the domain spelling.

### "SSL Certificate Not Issued"

**Cause**: SSL provisioning failed due to misconfigured CAA records.

### "Expired Domain" (Draft: Confirm exact error wording)

**Cause**: The domain may have been removed from Globe or expired in the registrar.

**Fix**:

- Check if the domain is still registered with your provider.
- If removed from Globe, re-add it through the Dashboard.

## Removing or Changing a Domain

Since each project can only have one domain currently, you must remove the existing domain before adding a new one.

### To remove a domain:

1. Go to the Globe Dashboard → Domains.
2. Click on the existing domain.
3. Click "Remove Domain".

Once removed, you can add a new custom domain following the setup steps above.
