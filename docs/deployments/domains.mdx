# Domains

A domain is the address of your deployment.

Each deployment, production or preview gets assigned a unique domain that directly points to the specific deployment. If the deployment is not yet ready or successful, visiting a domain will redirect you to the dashboard for that deployment.

## Production domains

Each project gets assigned a unique domain when it is created. Whenever you successfully deploy to the production environment, the production domain will be updated to point to the latest deployment.

### Custom Domains

Custom domains are not yet supported. We are working on it.
