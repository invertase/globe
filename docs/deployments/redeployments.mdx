# Redeployments

Redeployments are the process of triggering a new deployment build from a previous deployment. This is useful if you update build settings or environment variables and want to apply those changes without making any other changes to your code.

Redeployments apply any new build settings and environment variables you might have updated since the original deployment.

## Redeploying from the Dashboard

To redeploy from the dashboard, click the **Redeploy** button on the deployment you want to redeploy:

## Redeploying other redeployments

When redeploying a redeployment, the original deployment will be used as the base for the new deployment.
