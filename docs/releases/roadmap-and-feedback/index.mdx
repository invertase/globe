title: Roadmap & Feedback
---

**Globe is the full-stack platform for Dart & Flutter.**

We’re building the backend services, infrastructure, and tools that make it fast and simple to build production-ready Flutter apps - without switching languages, configuring cloud platforms, or working around tools that weren’t built for Dart.

Our focus is on:
- **Extending what you can build in Dart** - use shared types and a single language across your whole stack.
- **Providing a full set of backend services** - auth, storage, database, functions, and more.
- **Supporting any Dart backend framework** - so you’re not locked in to one way of building.
- **Handling deployment and scaling** - automatic deploys and preview environments from your repo.
- **Giving you control without config** - manage projects, environments, and usage from a single dashboard.
- **Helping you move faster** - with guides, templates, and tutorials.

We’re committed to building Globe in the open, with clear priorities and real input from developers.

In our roadmap & feedback board, you can:
- See what’s planned or in progress
- Submit ideas and feature requests
- Vote and comment to help us prioritise

We use it to guide what we build next & every vote and comment helps us better understand what matters most to you.
