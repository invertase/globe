## **What We're Working On** 

💳 **Billing & Payments:** We're rolling out subscription management across Free, Pro, and Enterprise tiers. We’ve integrated Paddle to handle financial events seamlessly, alongside a user-friendly interface for managing subscriptions, add-ons and more.

📊 **Usage Metrics & Analytics:** Helping you better track your projects' performance is a top priority. We’re improving your dashboard to give you deeper insights into how your projects are doing within Globe with build logs.  

🐞 **Bug Fixes:** We've been working hard to fix those annoying cron job timeouts and visibility issues with real-time build logs, ensuring your tasks run smoothly.

💬 **Support:** We're enhancing our support experience by implementing private threads for paying customers within Discord. This will enable real-time communication and provide tailored assistance, allowing customers to connect directly with our support team and share feedback seamlessly. We’ll also work on our general support process and FAQ content, so everyone can find what they need.

## **Our Focus Areas** 


**🌐 Unified Developer Experience**  
We are building towards a unified developer experience for Dart and Flutter developers. Our goal is to integrate backend and frontend development tools more seamlessly, making Globe the go-to platform for full-stack development.

**📦 Integrated Backend Solutions**  
We envision a backend ecosystem that seamlessly connects all elements of your development journey. Globe aims to offer flexible, modular tools that let developers choose exactly what they need while ensuring everything works in harmony. Our approach is to create an environment where backend features are effortlessly integrated, sustainable, and easy to adopt—enabling developers to grow from small-scale projects to enterprise-level applications without friction.

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community and Open-Source Engagement**  
Our community remains at the core of our progress. We plan to introduce more community-driven features and forums within Globe, along with feedback loops directly integrated into the platform. This aligns with our open-source principles, empowering developers to actively participate in shaping the product.

**📈 Empowering Full-Stack Transition**  
We are focused on making the transition from frontend to full-stack development smoother for Flutter developers by delivering:

* **Structured Tutorials and Globe Templates**: Expanding our existing tutorials and adding more ready-to-use Globe templates for backend projects.  
  * **Integrated Learning Tools**: Bringing more interactive learning tools into the platform, helping developers upskill without leaving the Globe ecosystem.
