# Web Sockets

Web Sockets enable you to open a two-way interactive communication session between your clients and server. This is a great way to build real-time applications like chat, games, and monitoring tools.

Globe has currently disabled Web Sockets connections whilst we monitor our infrastructure during the preview period.
