title: Performance
---

Globe is built for **responsive**, **serverless** workloads. Performance is handled automatically across a **distributed infrastructure**, so your apps stay **fast** without requiring manual setup. Understanding how this works helps you design more efficient applications.

## Key Behaviours

### Global Edge Network

Globe utilizes a globally distributed edge network spanning [300+ cities in over 100 countries](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/):

- Requests are automatically routed to the nearest **edge location**
- Initial request processing happens close to your users
- Static assets are cached at **edge locations**
- Request routing optimizes for minimal [latency](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/)
- [DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) protection and security filtering happen without a performance penalty

This edge network ensures that users worldwide experience minimal **latency** when accessing your application.

### Automatic Scaling

Globe's serverless infrastructure dynamically scales to match your application's needs:

- New containers are provisioned on **demand** as traffic increases
- Resources scale down automatically during periods of low usage
- No manual configuration of **scaling rules** required
- Scaling happens independently in each region based on local demand
- No practical upper limit on concurrent request handling

This scaling behavior ensures your application remains responsive under varying loads without requiring your intervention.

### Resource Efficiency

Globe optimizes resource utilization through intelligent container management:

- Containers run only when processing requests
- No resources are wasted on idle processes
- Pay only for actual **compute usage**
- Short-lived operations use minimal resources
- **Memory** and **CPU allocation** are optimized based on workload

This approach eliminates the overhead of maintaining continuously running servers.

### Advanced Caching Mechanisms

Globe implements multi-layered caching to improve performance:

- Static asset **caching** at edge locations
- Regional response caching minimizes repeated compute
- **Cache control** via standard HTTP headers
- Automatic cache invalidation on new deployments
- Fine-grained cache control settings available

Proper use of caching can dramatically improve application performance while reducing compute resource usage.

## Optimising App Performance

### Optimize for Cold Starts

Minimizing the impact of cold starts improves user experience:

- Keep dependencies minimal and well-managed
- Optimize application **startup code**
- Use **lazy initialization** where appropriate
- Consider regional **warming strategies** for critical endpoints
- Monitor cold start frequency with the `x-globe-temperature` header

See the [Cold Starts](/infrastructure/overview/cold-starts) documentation for more details.

### Design for Parallel Processing

Globe's distributed architecture works best with parallel processing patterns:

- Break large operations into smaller **parallel tasks**
- Use **asynchronous programming** patterns
- Implement appropriate **timeout handling**
- Design with **eventual consistency** in mind
- Consider **database connection pooling** for data-intensive operations

### Optimize Database Operations

Efficient database access is critical for serverless applications:

- Use **connection pooling** when possible
- Implement **caching** for frequently accessed data
- Keep database connections short-lived
- Use efficient **queries** and **indexes**
- Consider **database proximity** when configuring preferred regions

### Leverage HTTP Caching Headers

Control caching behavior with standard HTTP headers:

- Use `Cache-Control` headers to define caching policies
- Set appropriate `ETag` values for content validation
- Implement conditional requests with `If-None-Match`
- Use `Vary` headers to cache content variants
- Define reasonable `max-age` values based on content volatility

```dart
Response handleAssetRequest(Request request) {
  return Response.ok(assetContent, headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=86400', // Cache for 24 hours
    'ETag': computeETag(assetContent),
  });
}
```

### Optimize Asset Delivery

Efficient asset delivery improves perceived performance:

- Compress text-based assets (`JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML`)
- Optimize **image sizes** and formats
- Use appropriate **compression algorithms**
- Consider implementing a **CDN** for static content
- Set long **cache lifetimes** for static assets

## Common Performance Pitfalls

Avoid these common issues that can impact performance:

- Excessive **cold starts** due to underutilized regions
- Long-running **synchronous operations**
- Inefficient **database** queries
- Missing or inappropriate **cache headers**
- Large dependencies increasing **startup time**
- **Memory leaks** in long-running processes
