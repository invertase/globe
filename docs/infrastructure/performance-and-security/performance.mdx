description: Optimize your Globe deployments for performance with automatic scaling, global edge network, caching strategies, and best practices for Dart and Flutter apps.
---

Globe is built for responsive, serverless workloads. Performance is handled automatically across a distributed infrastructure, so your apps stay fast without requiring manual setup. Understanding how this works helps you design more efficient applications.

## Key Behaviors

### Global Edge Network

Globe utilizes a globally distributed edge network spanning [300+ cities in over 100 countries](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/):

- Requests are automatically routed to the nearest edge location
- Initial request processing happens close to your users
- Static assets are cached at edge locations
- Request routing optimizes for minimal [latency](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/)
- [DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) protection and security filtering happen without a performance penalty

This edge network ensures that users worldwide experience minimal latency when accessing your application.

### Automatic Scaling

Globe's serverless infrastructure dynamically scales to match your application's needs:

- New containers are provisioned on demand as traffic increases
- Resources scale down automatically during periods of low usage
- No manual configuration of scaling rules required
- Scaling happens independently in each region based on local demand
- No practical upper limit on concurrent request handling

This scaling behavior ensures your application remains responsive under varying loads without requiring your intervention.

### Resource Efficiency

Globe optimizes resource utilization through intelligent container management:

- Containers run only when processing requests
- No resources are wasted on idle processes
- Pay only for actual compute usage
- Short-lived operations use minimal resources
- Memory and CPU allocation are optimized based on workload

This approach eliminates the overhead of maintaining continuously running servers.

### Advanced Caching Mechanisms

Globe implements multi-layered caching to improve performance:

- Static asset caching at edge locations
- Regional response caching minimizes repeated compute
- Cache control via standard HTTP headers
- Automatic cache invalidation on new deployments
- Fine-grained cache control settings available

Proper use of caching can dramatically improve application performance while reducing compute resource usage.

## Optimizing App Performance

### Optimize for Cold Starts

Minimizing the impact of cold starts improves user experience:

- Keep dependencies minimal and well-managed
- Optimize application startup code
- Use lazy initialization where appropriate
- Consider regional warming strategies for critical endpoints
- Monitor cold start frequency with the `x-globe-temperature` header

See the [Cold Starts](/infrastructure/overview/cold-starts) documentation for more details.

### Design for Parallel Processing

Globe's distributed architecture works best with parallel processing patterns:

- Break large operations into smaller parallel tasks
- Use asynchronous programming patterns
- Implement appropriate timeout handling
- Design with eventual consistency in mind
- Consider database connection pooling for data-intensive operations

### Optimize Database Operations

Efficient database access is critical for serverless applications:

- Use connection pooling when possible
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Keep database connections short-lived
- Use efficient queries and indexes
- Consider database proximity when configuring preferred regions

### Leverage HTTP Caching Headers

Control caching behavior with standard HTTP headers:

- Use `Cache-Control` headers to define caching policies
- Set appropriate `ETag` values for content validation
- Implement conditional requests with `If-None-Match`
- Use `Vary` headers to cache content variants
- Define reasonable `max-age` values based on content volatility

```dart
Response handleAssetRequest(Request request) {
  return Response.ok(assetContent, headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=86400', // Cache for 24 hours
    'ETag': computeETag(assetContent),
  });
}
```

### Optimize Asset Delivery

Efficient asset delivery improves perceived performance:

- Compress text-based assets (`JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML`)
- Optimize image sizes and formats
- Use appropriate compression algorithms
- Consider implementing a CDN for static content
- Set long cache lifetimes for static assets

## Common Performance Pitfalls

Avoid these common issues that can impact performance:

- Excessive cold starts due to underutilized regions
- Long-running synchronous operations
- Inefficient database queries
- Missing or inappropriate cache headers
- Large dependencies increasing startup time
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
