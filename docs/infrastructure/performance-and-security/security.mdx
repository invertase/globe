Security is built into Globe's platform. Your apps run in isolated environments with network-level protections and ongoing monitoring.

## Security Architecture

Globe employs a layered security approach that combines container isolation, runtime restrictions, and robust network defenses. These protections work together to reduce risk and provide a secure-by-default environment.

### Deployment Isolation

- **Sandboxed Environments**: Each deployment runs in its own isolated environment, preventing unauthorized access between applications
- **Runtime Restrictions**: Strict limits on system calls to prevent unsafe operations
- **Resource Isolation**: CPU and memory usage are isolated per deployment to prevent interference and resource contention

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Encryption**: All traffic between your apps and Globe is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS), protecting data in transit
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in edge-level defenses help mitigate denial-of-service attacks and keep your apps accessible
- **Controlled Network Access**: Fine-grained controls over inbound and outbound traffic reduce exposure to external threats
- **Secure Request Handling**: All requests are validated and sanitized to guard against injection attacks and malformed inputs

## Security Best Practices

To maximize the security of your Globe deployments:

### Configuration Security

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in environment variables, not in your code
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions your application truly needs to function
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and packages updated to take advantage of the latest security patches

#### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent [injection attacks](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/injection-attack/)
- **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs correctly to avoid [XSS vulnerabilities](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/)
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms to verify user identity
- **Authorization**: Enforce access controls to protect sensitive resources and operations

### Security Compliance

Globe's infrastructure is regularly updated with security patches to maintain compliance with industry standards. The platform is designed to help you build applications that can meet various compliance requirements.
