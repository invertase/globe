Security is built into Globeâ€™s platform. Your apps run in isolated environments with **network-level protections** and ongoing **monitoring**.

## Security Architecture

Globe employs a layered security approach that combines **container isolation**, **runtime restrictions**, and robust **network defenses**. These protections work together to reduce risk and provide a **secure-by-default** environment.

### Deployment Isolation

- **Sandboxed Environments**: Each deployment runs in its own isolated **environment**, preventing unauthorized access between applications.
- **Runtime Restrictions**: Strict limits on **system calls** to prevent unsafe operations.
- **Resource Isolation**: **CPU** and **memory** usage are isolated per deployment to prevent interference and resource contention.

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Encryption**: All traffic between your apps and Globe is encrypted using **HTTPS (TLS)**, protecting data in transit.
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in edge-level defenses help mitigate **denial-of-service** attacks and keep your apps accessible.
- **Controlled Network Access**: Fine-grained controls over **inbound** and **outbound traffic** reduce exposure to external threats.
- **Secure Request Handling**: All requests are validated and sanitized to guard against **injection attacks** and malformed inputs.

## Security Best Practices

To maximize the security of your Globe deployments:

### Configuration Security

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information **(API keys, passwords)** in environment variables, not in your code.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions your application truly needs to function.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and packages updated to take advantage of the latest **security patches**.

#### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent [injection attacks](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/injection-attack/).
- **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs correctly to avoid [XSS vulnerabilities](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/).
- **Authentication**: Use strong **authentication** mechanisms to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Enforce **access controls** to protect sensitive resources and operations.

### Security Compliance

Globe's infrastructure is regularly updated with **security patches** to maintain compliance with industry standards. The platform is designed to help you build applications that can meet various **compliance** requirements.
