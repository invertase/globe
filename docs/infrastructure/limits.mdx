## Limits

Globe imposes a few request limits to ensure that the platform is not abused.

#### File System

You should only rely on the file system for temporary storage such as processing of files. Any files created during a request will be removed once the request is finished.

#### Execution Timeout

A single request is allowed to run for a maximum duration. If a request takes longer than the allowed duration, the request will be terminated.

During preview the maximum duration is currently **5 seconds**. We may increase this based on feedback and also allow higher limits for paid plans in the future.

#### CPU Usage

You cannot perform CPU heavy tasks for an extended period of time (determined by the current infrastructure load). Any requests that exceed the allotted CPU usage will be terminated.

#### Memory Usage

Each container has a limited amount of memory available (128MB). Performing ongoing memory-heavy tasks may result in the request being terminated. We may increase this based on feedback and also allow higher limits for paid plans in the future.

#### FFI

Usage of FFI (via `dart:ffi`) is not currently supported. We are working on providing this in the future.
