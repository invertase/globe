# Cold Starts

Globe infrastructure is built in a way to minimize and reduce the impact of cold starts. When a request starts a new container on demand this is known as a cold start.

In Globe however we have 3 levels of 'starts';

- `cold` - Container image has to be fetched, cached and started.
  - This is usually when your deployment has not yet had any requests in a specific compute region or has been idle for an extended period of time.
- `warm` - Container image is already fetched and cached but not started.
  - This happens when a `hot` running container becomes idle for a period of time in a specific region and the running container is paused.
- `hot` - Container image is already fetched, cached and still running.
  - This happens when requests in a specific region have kept the container from idling.

Overall you should experience a reduced number of cold starts compared to other cloud providers as well as a reduced cold start time. During the private preview you can expect to see some cold starts of around 500ms. We're still working on reducing this number.

## Mitigating cold starts

Whilst it may not necessary for every application; there are a number of ways you can help mitigate the impact of cold starts specific to your deployment;

- Reduce the size of your application by removing unnecessary dependencies and imports.

## Detecting cold starts

Each request to a Globe deployment has a custom header appended to it. The `x-globe-temperature` header will have a value of the start state:

- `cold`
- `warm`
- `hot`
