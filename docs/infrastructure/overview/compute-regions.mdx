title: Compute Regions
---

After a request passes through the [Global CDN & Edge Network](/infrastructure/overview/global-cdn), it's processed by your Dart application in a Compute Region. These are the global data centers where your code runs.

This page focuses on the compute regions and how you can configure their behavior for optimal performance.

### Default Behavior

Globe optimizes request handling through intelligent loadbalancers that distribute traffic efficiently across compute regions. These loadbalancers:

- Automatically route requests to maintain optimal performance
- Balance workloads based on regional capacity and response times
- Prevent overloading of any single compute region
- Ensure consistent application performance regardless of user location

## When to Use Preferred Regions

For most applications, the default behavior is ideal. However, you should consider specifying **preferred regions** when your application has specific geographic needs, such as:

- Connecting to a **region-specific database** or external service.
- Ensuring **data residency** to comply with local regulations.
- Consolidating processing in specific regions to manage resources.

A common use case is co-locating your compute with your database. If your app in Europe needs to make multiple queries to a database in North America, it's often faster to run the code in a North American **compute region** to minimize high-latency, transatlantic round-trip.

## How to Configure Preferred Regions

You can configure preferred regions in two ways:

- **Via Globe Dashboard**: In your project settings, you can select one or more preferred regions. This configuration applies to all new deployments.
- **Via HTTP Header**: For per-request control, use the `X-Globe-Preferred-Region` header (e.g., `X-Globe-Preferred-Region: DFW, PDX`) to override the dashboard settings.

## Available Compute Regions

Globe uses three-letter IATA airport codes to identify regions.
