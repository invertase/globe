title: Resources & Limits
description: Understand Globe's resource limits including requests, bandwidth, memory, CPU, execution time, databases, and cron jobs for your Dart and Flutter applications.
---

Globe runs your applications on a globally distributed infrastructure designed for automatic routing, caching, and scaling. To maintain high reliability and platform stability, we apply resource usage limits based on fair use principles.

Understanding these limits helps you design resilient applications and avoid unexpected disruptions.

## Default Resource Allowances

Your Globe account operates with the following default resource thresholds and behaviors:

| **Resource**          | **Current Thresholds** | **Notes**                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requests**          | 50K per month          | All HTTP requests count toward this limit          |
| **Compute Bandwidth** | 1GB per month          | API responses and server-rendered content          |
| **Asset Bandwidth**   | 1GB per month          | Static assets (images, scripts, fonts)             |
| **Memory**            | 256MB per container    | Per running instance of your application           |
| **Databases**         | 2 active databases     | Per organization limit                             |
| **Cron Jobs**         | 1 cron job             | With unlimited invocations                         |
| **CPU Usage**         | Varies based on load   | Avoid CPU-heavy tasks for extended periods         |
| **Execution time**    | 30 seconds per request | Maximum processing time allowed per single request |

These baseline thresholds are intended for general use. Production apps should monitor usage and optimize accordingly.

## Requests

Your Globe account includes 50K requests per month. Every HTTP interaction with your app counts toward this total, including:

- API endpoint calls
- Page views rendered by your application
- Requests for static assets (like images or scripts), even if served from Globe's edge cache
- Each new WebSocket connection established

When your application reaches this request limit, any new incoming requests will be rejected with an error response until your usage cycle resets at the start of the next month.

## Bandwidth

Your account includes two separate bandwidth allowances:

### Compute Bandwidth (1GB per month)

Compute bandwidth covers API responses and server-rendered content. Usage is calculated based on the total size of:

- Response payload from your application
- Request payload to your application
- HTTP headers

### Asset Bandwidth (1GB per month)

Asset bandwidth covers static assets like images, scripts, fonts, and other files. This includes:

- Images, CSS, JavaScript files
- Font files and other static resources
- Any static content served by your application

If you exceed either bandwidth allowance, you may experience request rejections or slower service. Both bandwidth allowances reset monthly.

## Memory Usage

Each running instance of your application in Globe has access to 256MB of memory.

If your application exceeds this memory limit, Globe will terminate your application instance. Also, any active requests will fail as a result.

## CPU Usage

Globe dynamically monitors CPU load across the platform. There's no hard limit per instance; instead, applications using excessive CPU for extended periods may have requests terminated.

## Execution Time

Each request to your application is allowed a maximum of 30 seconds from start to finish, from the time Globe receives the request to when the response is completed.

If a request takes longer than 30 seconds, it will be automatically terminated, regardless of its progress.

## Databases

Your Globe account includes 2 active databases per organization. Each database provides:

- Serverless SQLite compatibility with LibSQL protocol
- Integrated dashboard for data management and querying
- External client support for connecting from any LibSQL-compatible tool

When you reach your database limit, you must delete an existing database before creating a new one.

## Cron Jobs

Your Globe account includes 1 cron job with unlimited invocations. Cron jobs allow you to:

- Schedule recurring tasks using standard cron syntax
- Execute HTTP requests to specific endpoints in your application
- Run automatically after production deployments
- Monitor execution through the Globe dashboard

Cron jobs run in UTC timezone and are synchronized with your production deployments.

## No Overage Charges

Globe provides predictable pricing with no overage charges. When you reach your limits, requests are rejected rather than incurring additional fees, giving you full control over your costs.
