title: Global CDN & Edge Network
description: Learn how Globe's global CDN and edge network with 300+ locations provides fast, secure, and highly available access to your Dart and Flutter applications worldwide.

Globe is designed to be global by default. Your application is served by a high-performance Global CDN (Content Delivery Network) that acts as the front door for all your traffic, ensuring a fast and secure experience for users everywhere.

This network is the first point of contact for every request.

## How the Edge Network Works

Powered by Cloudflare's global infrastructure, Globe's Edge Network spans more than [300 cities across 100+ countries](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/). This network sits milliseconds away from virtually every internet user.

When a user sends a request to your application, it's automatically intercepted by the nearest edge location, which performs three key actions:

1. **Security Filtering**: The network provides built-in DDoS protection and security filtering, mitigating threats before they can reach your application
2. **Serving Cached Content**: If the request is for a static asset, it's served directly from the edge cache for the fastest possible response. See [Automatic Caching](/infrastructure/overview/automatic-caching) for details
3. **Intelligent Routing**: For all other requests, the Edge Network intelligently forwards the traffic to be processed by your Dart application in the nearest [Compute Region](/infrastructure/overview/compute-regions)

## Benefits of the Global CDN

- **Global Performance**: Users worldwide experience minimal latency because they connect to a server that is geographically close to them
- **Enhanced Security**: Your application is protected by default from a wide range of common web threats, with no configuration required
- **High Availability**: The distributed nature of the network means traffic is automatically rerouted if a location has an issue, increasing your application's uptime
