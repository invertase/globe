title: Deploy Flutter Web

# Deploy a Flutter Web Application

To get started, we're going to create a Flutter application and deploy Flutter Web to Globe. Globe has preconfigured build presets and it will be automatically detected and applied. If your application uses `build_runner`, then it will also automatically be detected and runs it during the building stage of the deployment.

## Create a new Flutter project

To create a basic Flutter application, in your terminal, run the following command where you'd like to create a project:

```bash
flutter create my_flutter_app
cd my_flutter_app
```

## Deployment

Deploying to Globe is simple; run the `globe deploy` command from your project root in the terminal:

```bash
globe deploy
```

The first time you deploy, you'll:

1. Be prompted to continue with the setup of the deployment (press `Y`)
1. Enter a name for your project: Enter: `my-flutter-app`

The CLI will show the following output:
```
Detected "Flutter" preset, would you like to use the default build settings? (Y/n)
```
Press Enter to select the build settings.

After waiting for a couple of seconds, you'll be shown that your new deployment has been queued and be provided a unique URL for that deployment. You can visit this URL in your browser to view the build logs and deployment status. You can also use the [`build-logs`](/cli/commands/build-logs) command to view the logs directly from the CLI.

## View your application

Once complete, your deployment will be available via the URL shown in the dashboard. Each deployment has its own unique URL, with a `globeapp.dev` domain. Click the URL and you'll visit your Flutter Web Application.
