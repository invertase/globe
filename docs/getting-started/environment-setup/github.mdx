title: Connecting to GitHub
description: Connect your GitHub account to Globe to enable automatic deployments from your repositories with GitHub integration and event triggers.
---

To use the GitHub integration, you’ll need an existing GitHub repository or create one before connecting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Account Settings">
    In the Globe dashboard, go to **Account**
    <Image src="/assets/account-settings.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your GitHub Account">
    In the Connected Accounts section, select **Connect your GitHub account**
    <Image src="/assets/connect-account.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Dart Globe">
    Authorise access to your GitHub repositories
    <Image src="/assets/authorize-github-account.png" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your GitHub account is now connected. Every push to your repositories can trigger automatic deployments: **preview deployments** for feature branches, and **production deployments** when you merge to your main branch.
