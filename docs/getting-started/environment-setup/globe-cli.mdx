  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Run the command below in your terminal:
    ```bash 
    dart pub global activate globe_cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
   Confirm that the CLI is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    globe --version
    ```

    This outputs the version number of the Globe CLI, confirming a successful installation.

You can now deploy directly from your project directory.
