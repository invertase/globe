title: Setting up the Globe CLI
description: Install and authenticate the Globe CLI to deploy Dart and Flutter applications directly from your terminal with full control over deployments.
---

The CLI gives you full control from the terminal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Run the command below in your terminal:
    ```bash 
    dart pub global activate globe_cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
   Confirm that the CLI is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    globe --version
    ```

    This outputs the version number of the Globe CLI, confirming a successful installation.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Log in to your Globe account">
   Authenticate your CLI with your Globe account:

    ```bash
    globe login
    ```

    This opens a browser window to complete the login process. Once authenticated, you'll see a confirmation message in your terminal:

    ```
    ✓ Successfully logged in!
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Warning>
  If `globe` is not recognized after installation, ensure your Dart SDK's `bin`
  directory is in your system PATH. Run `dart pub global list` to verify the CLI
  is installed.
</Warning>
