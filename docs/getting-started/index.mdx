  [Install Dart →](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

<Info>If you have Flutter installed, the Dart SDK is already included.</Info>

### Choose Your Deployment Method

You can deploy in two ways:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Globe CLI" href="/getting-started/environment-setup/globe-cli">
    Deploy from your terminal using a lightweight CLI tool. Great for local
    development, quick iteration, and preview builds.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="GitHub Integration"
    href="/getting-started/environment-setup/github"
  >
    Connect your GitHub repo and deploy automatically on every push — perfect
    for teams and Git-based workflows.
