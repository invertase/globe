title: Getting started with Globe
---

To get started using Globe, ensure you have [logged in](https://globe.dev/login) to your account.

There are two ways to deploy to Globe:
- Using the [Globe CLI](#install-the-globe-cli-optional), or
- Using the [GitHub integration](/deployments/github-integration)

## Install the Globe CLI (optional)

The Globe CLI is a command line tool that allows you to interact with your Globe account and deploy from the command line. It is not required to use Globe, but it can be useful for some workflows.

#### Pre-requisites

To get started, you must have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed on your machine.

#### Installation

To install the Globe CLI, run the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate globe_cli
```

Once installed, you can access the globe executable from anywhere on your machine.

To login with your Globe account, run the following command:

```bash
globe login
```

To learn more about the CLI, view the [documentation](/cli).

## Deploying your first application

You can deploy your Dart applications to a Globally distributed network using the [framework of your choice](/frameworks). It is possible to deploy both Backend and Frontend applications as shown below. For simplicity, the CLI will be used for deployment.

- [Frontend Flutter Web Application](/getting-started/flutter-web)
