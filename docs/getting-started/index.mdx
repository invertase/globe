Deploy your first Dart or Flutter application in minutes. Complete the prerequisites below, then choose a deployment method that fits your workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have the following:

- **Dart SDK Installed** — [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- **A Globe.dev account** — [Sign up or log in](https://globe.dev/login)

<Info>If you have Flutter installed, the Dart SDK is already included.</Info>

## Choose Your Deployment Method

Globe supports two deployment methods. Choose based on your workflow:

| Method                 | Best For                                           | How It Works                                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Globe CLI**          | Local development, quick iteration, manual control | Run `globe deploy` from your terminal          |
| **GitHub Integration** | Teams, CI/CD, automatic deployments                | Push to GitHub and Globe deploys automatically |

<Info>
  **New to Globe?** Start with the CLI to understand the deployment process,
  then add GitHub integration for automation later.
