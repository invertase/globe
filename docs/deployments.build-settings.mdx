# Build Settings

Build settings allow you to configure how your project is build during a new deployment. You can configure your build settings via the dashboard: **Project** -> **Settings** -> **General**.

![Project Settings](/docs/project-settings.png)

## Settings

You can configure the following build settings:

- [Dart Version](#dart-version)
- [Root Directory](#root-directory)
- [Framework Preset](#framework-preset)
- [Build Command](#build-command)
- [Entrypoint](#entrypoint)

---

### Dart Version

The Dart version to use when building your project. By default, Globe will use the latest stable version of Dart. Currently Dart supports `stable` and `beta` version branches.

Support for specific tagged versions is coming soon.

---

### Root Directory

The root directory is the directory which contains your project source. If working with mono-repositories of a directory structure where your application is not at the root where the `pubspec.yaml` file exists.

---

### Framework Preset

Globe supports existing [frameworks](/docs/frameworks). If a framework is specified here, Globe will use default values required to build and deploy your framework application. If you'd like to override these values, you can do so by specifying a value in the specific build settings.

---

### Build Command

A build command can be executed after project dependencies have been installed. This is useful if you need to run a build step before your application can be deployed.

If using a **Framework Preset**, a default value will be used instead. You can override this by specifying a value here.

---

### Entrypoint

When building your application, the build system requires an entrypoint file which is used to bootstrap your application. The is typically the `lib/main.dart` file in your project
which contains a `main` function.

This setting can be configured if your application uses a different entrypoint file.

If using a **Framework Preset**, a default value will be used instead. You can override this by specifying a value here.
