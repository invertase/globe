# Deploying a Dart Frog application

[Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/) is a fast, minimalistic backend framework for Dart which is built on top of [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf). Dart Frog supports routing, middleware, and DI out of the box with a local CLI to assist with development.

Follow their [documentation](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/docs/overview) for assistance with installing the CLI.

## Create a new project

Create a new Dart Frog project by running the following command:

```bash
dart_frog create my_dart_frog_app
```

Start a local development server with the following command:

```bash
dart_frog dev
```

## Deploying to Globe

Deploying your project through the CLI or the dashboard will work as normal. Globe will detect Dart Frog is being used and automatically select it as a framework preset on your project settings. No additional steps are required.
