If your `globe deploy` command fails with a **413 Request Entity Too Large** error, it means your project folder has exceeded Cloudflare's 100 MB upload limit. This page will walk you through how to fix it.

## Symptoms

When you run `globe deploy`, the process fails during the file upload step. You might see an error in your terminal, and the build logs on your Globe dashboard will show a **`413 Request Entity Too Large`** status code.

## Cause

This error occurs because the total size of your project directory exceeds **Cloudflare's 100 MB upload limit**. Globe is built on Cloudflare's infrastructure, which enforces this limit. When your project is too large, the request is blocked before a deployment can be created.

## Solution

To resolve this, you need to reduce the size of your project folder by telling Globe which files and directories to ignore during deployment.

### Option 1: Deploy from the Project's Directory

The most common cause of this error is running the `globe deploy` command from the wrong directory. You should run the command from the root of the specific project you intend to deploy.

For example, if your project is located at `~/dev/my_app`, you should navigate to that directory first:

```bash
# Navigate to your project's root folder
cd ~/dev/my_app

# Run the deploy command from here
globe deploy
```

This ensures only the files inside `my_app` are included in the upload.

### Option 2: Exclude Unnecessary Files

If your project directory itself is over 100 MB, you need to exclude unnecessary files from the deployment bundle.

#### 1. Identify Large Files and Directories

First, find out what's taking up the most space. You can use your terminal to list the largest files and directories.

```bash
# Run this command in your project's root directory
du -sh * | sort -rh
```

Common culprits in a Dart or Flutter project include:

- **Build artifacts**: `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, `.packages`
- **Platform-specific build folders**: `ios/`, `android/`, `linux/`, `windows/`, `macos/` (if you're not deploying for these platforms).
- **Large assets**: High-resolution images, videos, or other media.
- **Local databases or caches**.

#### 2. Exclude Files Using .gitignore

Once you've identified the large files and directories, you can exclude them by adding them to your project's `.gitignore` file. The Globe CLI automatically respects these rules and will not include matching files in the deployment.

**Example .gitignore entries**:

```.gitignore
# Large assets not needed in production
/public/videos/
/data/large_dataset.csv

# Local build artifacts
.dart_tool/
build/
dist/

# Local dependencies
node_modules/
```

By adding these patterns to your `.gitignore` file, you can significantly reduce the final upload size and resolve the error.
