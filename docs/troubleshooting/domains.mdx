If you encounter errors when adding, verifying, or connecting a custom domain to your Globe project, this guide will help you identify and resolve the issue.

## Domain Verification Failed

### Symptoms

Your domain shows a **"Verification Failed"** status in the Globe dashboard after adding it. The domain cannot be activated, and SSL certificates are not provisioned.

### Cause

This error occurs when Cloudflare cannot verify your DNS configuration. Common causes include:

- Missing or incorrect CNAME record pointing to `domains.globeapp.dev`
- DNS records not yet propagated (can take up to 24 hours)
- Incorrect DNS record configuration at your domain registrar

### Solution

1. **Check your DNS settings** with your domain provider; make sure the CNAME record exists and is correctly configured
2. **Verify the CNAME record** points to `domains.globeapp.dev` exactly (no trailing dots or typos)
3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (up to 24 hours) if you recently updated your DNS records
4. **Remove and re-add the domain** in Globe if the DNS records are confirmed correct but verification still fails

## Domain Stuck in Pending Verification

### Symptoms

Your domain remains in **"Pending Verification"** status for an extended period (more than a few hours). The domain appears to be processing but never transitions to "Active" status.

### Cause

This typically happens when DNS changes are still propagating across the global DNS network. DNS propagation can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours, depending on your domain registrar and geographic location.

### Solution

1. **Wait up to 24 hours** for DNS changes to fully propagate globally
2. **Check with your domain provider** to confirm the DNS changes have been saved and are active
3. **Verify the CNAME record** is correctly configured and visible in your DNS management panel
4. **Use DNS lookup tools** (like `dig` or online DNS checkers) to verify the CNAME record is resolving correctly

## Connection Errors After Domain Setup

### Symptoms

After successfully adding and verifying a domain, you experience connection errors when trying to access your application via the custom domain. The domain may show as "Active" but requests fail or time out.

### Cause

Connection errors can occur due to:

- Temporary DNS propagation delays
- Cached DNS records pointing to old configurations
- Incorrect DNS record configuration that passed initial verification

### Solution

1. **Remove and re-add the domain** in Globe; this can fix temporary connection errors and refresh the DNS verification
2. **Double-check your DNS records** match the requirements exactly (CNAME pointing to `domains.globeapp.dev`)
3. **Clear your DNS cache** locally and wait for your domain registrar to fully propagate the DNS changes
4. **Verify DNS propagation** using online tools to ensure the CNAME record is resolving correctly worldwide
