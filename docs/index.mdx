Globe is a deployment platform for [Dart](https://dart.dev/) developers, that allows you to deploy your Dart applications to a globally
distributed service without the need to manage servers, networks, or scaling. The core principle of Globe is a simplified deployment service
with great developer experience in mind.

## Features

Some of the core features of Globe include:

- **Deployments**: Deploy your Dart applications to Globe with a single command or automatically on every push to your Git repository. Globe supports both previewing and production deployments.
- **GitHub Integration**: Globe integrates with your existing CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy your applications on every push to your Git repository.
- **Custom domains**: Assign custom domains to your projects, with SSL certificates automatically generated and renewed for you.
- **Organization support**: Globe supports organizations, allowing you to manage multiple projects and users under a single account.

## Why Globe?

Dart on the server is a great choice for building server based applications, such as APIs, websites, and more. The language has great support for building these applications with packages such
as [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) and [Dart Frog](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog) providing a great base for getting started. However, deploying these applications can be a challenge for
a number of reasons:

- Developers require experience with cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Digital Ocean and more.
- Familiarity with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform is required to deploy applications.
- Critical components such as scaling, load balancing, and SSL certificates must be configured and monitored.
- Integrating with CI/CD flows can be challenging, especially when deploying multiple environments and preview deployments.
- This architecture comes with challenges such as managing cold starts, region based latency, and more.

Globe aims to solve these problems by providing a simple, easy to use deployment platform for Dart developers. Globe utilizes a number of cloud providers to provide a globally distributed service with the following benefits:

- Zero management overhead of servers, networking and scaling.
- Globally available regions. Globe deployments of your application are available around the world, providing low latency to your users and high availability.
- Globe automatically scales your application to meet demand.
- Built-in support for preview deployments, allowing you to preview every change, commit or PR before deploying to production.

Simply run the `deploy` command or push to your Git repository and Globe will create a globally managed deployment for you within seconds.
