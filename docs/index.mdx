# What is Globe?

Globe is a deployment platform for [Dart](https://dart.dev/) developers, that allows you to deploy your Dart **Backend**, **Frontend**, and **Flutter Web** applications to a globally
distributed service without the need to manage servers, networks, or scaling. The core principle of Globe is a simplified deployment service
with great developer experience in mind.

## Features

Some of the core features of Globe include:

- [Deployments][deployment-url]: Deploy your Dart applications to Globe with a single command or automatically on every push to your Git repository. Globe supports both [preview][preview-url] and [production][production-url] deployments.
- [GitHub Integration][github-integration-url]: Globe integrates with your existing GitHub repository to automatically deploy your applications on every push.
- [Custom domains][custom-domains-url]: Assign custom domains to your projects, with SSL certificates automatically generated and renewed for you.
- **Organization support**: Globe supports organizations, allowing you to manage multiple projects and users under a single account.

## Why Globe?

Dart on the server is a great choice for building server-based applications, such as APIs, websites, and more. The language has great support for building these applications with packages such
as [Shelf][shelf-url-ext] and [Dart Frog][dart-frog-url-ext] providing a great base for getting started. However, deploying these applications can be a challenge for
many reasons:

- Developers require experience with cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Digital Ocean, and more.
- Familiarity with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform is required to deploy applications.
- Critical components such as scaling, load balancing, and SSL certificates must be configured and monitored.
- Integrating with CI/CD flows can be challenging, especially when deploying multiple environments and preview deployments.
- This architecture comes with challenges such as managing cold starts, region-based latency, and more.

Globe aims to solve these problems by providing a simple, easy-to-use deployment platform for Dart developers. Globe utilizes several cloud providers to provide a globally distributed service with the following benefits:

- Zero management overhead of servers, networking, and scaling.
- Globally available regions. Globe deployments of your application are available around the world, providing low latency to your users and high availability.
- Globe automatically scales your application to meet demand.
- Built-in support for preview deployments, allowing you to preview every change, commit, or PR before deploying to production.

Simply run the `deploy` command or push to your Git repository and Globe will create a globally managed deployment for you within seconds.
