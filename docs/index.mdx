title: Globe Overview
---

**Globe** is a full-stack platform designed for **Dart** and **Flutter** developers seeking a streamlined and efficient way to build and deploy production-ready applications. It provides a comprehensive environment encompassing **backend services**, **deployment infrastructure**, and **developer tools**, all deeply integrated within the Dart ecosystem.

## What is Globe?

Globe is a deployment platform that enables Flutter developers to run their Dart code on a **globally distributed infrastructure** for both the front and backend. It automates the provisioning and management of **servers**, **networking**, and **scaling**, allowing developers to deploy their applications using simple **CLI commands** or **GitHub integration**.

Whether you are developing highly interactive web frontends with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), building server-rendered web UIs with frameworks like [Jaspr](https://jaspr.site/), or creating robust backend APIs using frameworks like [Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev/), [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf), and [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/), Globe helps you get your applications to users faster and deliver a great experience with built-in **scalability** and **reliability**.

## Why Choose Globe?

**Globe** gives Flutter developers a **Dart-native**, full-stack platform with **automatic backend integration**, **managed services**, and **no vendor lock-in**. Unlike Firebase, Supabase, or Amplify, it keeps your entire workflow in Dart; **no other languages**, **no manual infrastructure**, and **no enforced backend framework**.

### Why Developers Choose Globe

- **Dart-native workflow**: Build your entire app's frontend and backend in Dart. No context switching or separate runtimes.
- **Flexible backend**: Use any Dart backend framework (**Dart Frog**, **Shelf**, **Jaspr**, **Serverpod**) or none at all. You're not locked into a specific stack.
- **Managed services**: No custom SDKs or server config.
- **Zero DevOps**: Globe handles **servers**, **networking**, **scaling**, **SSL**, and **deployments**. No **Docker**, **YAML**, or cloud setup required.
- **Fast deployment**: Deploy preview or production builds from the **CLI** or **GitHub** in seconds.
- **Global performance**: Apps are deployed to a **global edge network** with **automatic scaling** and **low-latency delivery**.
- **Optimised for Flutter Web**: Specific support for Flutter web builds, including efficient **asset hosting** and **deployment**.
